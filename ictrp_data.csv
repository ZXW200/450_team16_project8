In each setting, groups of volunteers will be dermally exposed to single-sex (male) cercariae once at doses of between 10 and 30 cercariae. Depending on the outcome of the low dose infection, the dose will be escalated or additional volunteers will be exposed to the same number of cercariae. Volunteers will undergo intensive follow-up for 24 weeks and a late follow-up time point at 52 weeks. They will visit the clinical trial centre weekly after infection for 12 weeks. After this, two-weekly visits will continue until week 24. A final follow up visit will be after one year. During the visits, adverse events will be recorded, levels of Schistosoma mansoni circulating anodic antigen (CAA) will be measured and samples obtained for immunological analyses.  Immediately CAA is detected (expected around 6 to 8 weeks after infection) the volunteers will be treated with praziquantel to cure the Schistosoma infection. Praziquantel may be repeated 4 weeks later if CAA levels do not fall to zero. Volunteers will be required to avoid contact with potentially Schistosoma mansoni-contaminated water until the controlled infection has been shown to have been effectively cured, potentially a period of up to 14 weeks.

The study aim is to assess a combination of drugs for Chagas disease (CD) therapy, assuming benznidazol (BZ) as the drug of choice plus dissulfiram (DF) as repositioned drug. It is hypothesized that employing the drug of choice with a repositioned one, contributes to the establishment of a new effective, well-tolerated low-cost combination therapy for chronic CD patients. From eligibility confirmation, nine (n = 9) participants will be allocated to the first medication treatment level. The treatment will begin with the lowest dose of BZ for 60 days, corresponding to 100 mg/day associated with 250 mg/day of DF. Upon safety confirmation of the lowest dose of BZ, a new group of 9 patients (group II) will receive a higher dose of BZ (200 mg/day BZ + 250 mg/day DF). After confirming the safety of this dose, another group of 9 patients (group III) will receive the maximum recommended dose of BZ, which is 300 mg/day+250 mg/day DF. Directly after the completion of group III, we will start group IV with 9 others patients receiving the lowest dose of BZ, however associated with 500mg/day of DF. The scheduling scheme will be similar to that previously described for BZ dose progression. Thus, we will have group V (200mg/day of BZ + 500mg/day of DF) and group VI (300mg/day of BZ + 500mg/day of DF).

We examined the impact of a combination of human mass chemotherapy, snail control through mollusciciding and SjCTPI bovine vaccination on the human incidence of infection. Following the baseline survey, the interventions were implemented in 18 intervention groups from 2013 to 2017. The investigators, including the research team, and study participants were blind to the vaccine allocation. At baseline all residents (60 mg/kg directly observed split oral dose) and bovines (30 mg/kg directly feed oral dose) were treated with a directly observed oral dose of PZQ. Villages were then pair-matched for the RCT based on historical prevalence, baseline outcomes, and transmission ecology. One of three intervention ARMs (no specific intervention (control), human mass praziquantel (PZQ) treatment, mollusciciding) were randomly assigned to each pair to achieve three pairs per intervention type. Within each pair, one village was randomly assigned the active vaccine for vaccinating bovines and the other village received a placebo vaccine.

<br>        exclusion of children and pregnant women:
<br>
<br>        pregnant women will be excluded from this study since it involves administration of
<br>        medications contraindicated in pregnancy. children less than 14 years old will be excluded
<br>        because of the amount of blood required for the immunologic studies. the age of consent in
<br>        mali is 18 years of age, so children aged 14 to 17 years will sign an assent form in
<br>        addition to the consent form to be signed by a parent or tutor. however, married women
<br>        between the ages of 14 and 17 will sign consent as adults in view of the laws governing
<br>        emancipation of women in mali. subjects who do not participate in this study will receive

As patients were included in this study, they made over a period of one week a laboratory evaluation including complete blood count, glucose, urea and creatinine, uric acid, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, sodium, calcium and potassium, total proteins and fractions, liver function tests and thyroid, examination of stools and urine analysis for abnormal elements and sediment. These tests were performed throughout this study when clinically required. The first 30 days after inclusion were performed the following tests: the conventional resting ECG with 12 leads, chest x-ray postero-anterior and lateral, one and two dimensional echocardiography and Doppler study of oxidative stress.Similarly, throughout the study, these tests were repeated annually and when they were needed, that is, with the patient's clinical change, except the study of oxidative stress was always performed after the intervention occurred. Antioxidant defenses and oxidative stress biomarkers were measured in the study three times in their respective groups, one before surgery and 2 after carvedilol administration of carvedilol (six months) and then after joint administration of carvedilol with vitamin E and C for another 6 months (carvedilol 12.5 mg, 3 times daily for 6 months, at a dose of 800UI/day vitamin E and 500mg/day vitamin C, single dose for 6 months).<br><br><br><br><br>","Biochemical tests performed to test the antioxidant capacity of the drug carvedilol with / without vitamins E and C were the following: determining the activity of the following antioxidant enzymes: superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase and glutathione reductase.
