ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) affect more than one billion people globally, placing a disproportionate burden on socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. Despite their significant health impact, research on NTDs remains underfunded and underrepresented compared to other global health priorities.
This project analyses 315 clinical studies registered in the World Health Organizationâ€™s International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), 
The dataset spans the period 1999â€“2023.

ðŸ“Š Data Source
ï»¿
The dataset originates from the World Health Organizationâ€™s (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), which consolidates registrations from multiple national and international trial registries.
Scope: All available NTD-related clinical trial records (1999â€“2023)
Size: 315 studies
Curation: Data has been curated and partially standardised by the Infectious Diseases Data Observatory (IDDO) to enhance consistency, while retaining certain raw fields where full standardisation was not feasible.
Disease Classification: Follows the official definitions provided by the WHO.
This comprehensive dataset provides a global perspective on NTD research activity and enables robust analysis of long-term trends.
