ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This repository contains the work of Group Project 8, which focuses on analyzing Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) using clinical trial data from the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP).
The objectives of this project are:
Collect and preprocess datasets related to multiple NTDs.
Perform data cleaning (remove duplicates, standardize columns, handle missing values).
Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends.
Apply machine learning methods (classification, clustering, feature selection).
Visualize the distribution of clinical trials across diseases, regions, and years.
Summarize key findings for scientific and policy implications.
