ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) afflict more than one billion individuals globally, exerting a disproportionate burden on socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. Nevertheless, research pertaining to NTDs remains significantly underfunded relative to other global health priorities. This project synthesizes data from 315 studies registered in the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), encompassing Chagas disease, schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminthiases, and visceral leishmaniasis, published between 1999 and 2023.
The objective of this study is to elucidate patterns, disparities, and salient insights within NTD clinical research. The findings are expected to inform evidence-based policy formulation, optimize resource allocation, and guide the prioritization of future research within the global health community.

ðŸ“Š Data Source

The data for this project originates from the World Health Organizationâ€™s (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), which collates trial registrations from multiple international and national registries. The dataset encompasses all available years of Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD) clinical trial registrations between 1999â€“2023, covering every record retrievable from the ICTRP search portal.
To improve consistency, the dataset has been curated and partially standardised by the Infectious Diseases Data Observatory (IDDO), while retaining some raw variables where full standardisation was not feasible. The classification of NTDs in this study follows the definitions provided by WHO
This comprehensive dataset provides a reliable global perspective on NTD research activities, enabling robust analysis of long-term trends across all recorded years.
