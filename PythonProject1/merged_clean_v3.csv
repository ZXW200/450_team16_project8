The study aim is to assess a combination of drugs for Chagas disease (CD) therapy, assuming benznidazol (BZ) as the drug of choice plus dissulfiram (DF) as repositioned drug. It is hypothesized that employing the drug of choice with a repositioned one, contributes to the establishment of a new effective, well-tolerated low-cost combination therapy for chronic CD patients. From eligibility confirmation, nine (n = 9) participants will be allocated to the first medication treatment level. The treatment will begin with the lowest dose of BZ for 60 days, corresponding to 100 mg/day associated with 250 mg/day of DF. Upon safety confirmation of the lowest dose of BZ, a new group of 9 patients (group II) will receive a higher dose of BZ (200 mg/day BZ + 250 mg/day DF). After confirming the safety of this dose, another group of 9 patients (group III) will receive the maximum recommended dose of BZ, which is 300 mg/day+250 mg/day DF. Directly after the completion of group III, we will start group IV with 9 others patients receiving the lowest dose of BZ, however associated with 500mg/day of DF.

A diagnosis of cysticercosis was made on the basis of the established diagnostic criteria. Disseminated cysticercosis was defined as the presence of multiple (= 3) cystic viable lesions in the brain, along with evidence of involvement of at least one extra site, like subcutaneous tissues, skeletal muscles, eyes, or presence in any visceral organ.","Exclusion criteria: <br>        1.

Oxcarbazepine at a dose of 10-15 mg/kg/day was used as the first-line antiepileptic drug. If the control over seizures was neither obtained nor oxcarbazepine tolerated, levetiracetam was the next drug prescribed. To aid prompt control of seizures, clobazam was added for the initial 2-3 weeks; it was deemed that appropriate therapeutic levels of oxcarbazepine would have been achieved by this time. The patients were administered albendazole after excluding those with cysticercal encephalitis. In patients with vitreoretinal cysticercosis or cysticercal lesions abutting optic nerve, albendazole was initiated at least 6 weeks after the surgical excision of the cyst. Albendazole was given at a dose of 15 mg/kg/day (given in 2 divided doses). Three days prior to starting albendazole, the patients were primed with oral methylprednisolone (0.75-1 mg/kg of body weight) and it was continued in full dose during the course of albendazole therapy (28 days), followed by tapering in next 2-3 weeks (0.25 mg/kg /week). A total of 3 cycles of albendazole were administered; each cycle was of 28 days and the difference of 3 months between the two evaluations was calculated from the last tapered dose of oral methylprednisolone. The protocol warranted discontinuation of albendazole if any patient developed a rash or an untoward complication like raised intracranial pressure, signs of meningeal irritation, visual disturbances or suggestion of myelitis; oral methylprednisolone, however, was to be continued to manage the complications arising from the release of antigens.

In phase 1, the Delphi method will be applied, which will consist of consulting a panel of experts to obtain consensus on the criteria and guidelines for structuring a clinical protocol to be used in the intervention, in the subsequent phase of this study, as an auxiliary document in the provision of the pharmacotherapeutic monitoring service. The Delphi method will be conducted in successive rounds of structured questionnaires, seeking convergence of opinions. In phase 2, a quasi-experimental study will be conducted to evaluate before and after the intervention. The study will involve a single-arm research with a comparative evaluation of the effect of the intervention, before and after exposure. This design will allow an evaluation without inter-individual interference, since each participant will be compared with themselves before and after exposure, making the individual themselves their control group. Randomization will not be performed, since all admitted patients will undergo the intervention as part of the care routine. In addition, all participants will be aware of the intervention applied, and there will be no masking in its implementation. In stage 3, a retrospective cross-sectional descriptive observational study will be carried out, in which data will be collected and analyzed from existing records, allowing the construction of indicators to monitor the evolution of the process of implementing the pharmacotherapeutic monitoring service. Details of stage 2, a longitudinal epidemiological study of the quasi-experimental type. This is a non-randomized single-arm clinical study, in which there will be only one group that will be evaluated before and after the intervention. Experimental group: 100 patients with leprosy ","It is expected to observe an improvement in the effectiveness and safety of leprosy pharmacotherapy, assessed through the reduction/disappearance of skin lesions; normalization of the skin’s visual appearance (disappearance of hypochromic, brownish, or reddish spots); reduction/disappearance of motor limitations; normalization of neurological functions (reduction/disappearance of pain); negative conversion/reduction of bacilloscopy with fragmented bacilli; and completion of multidrug therapy doses.

This group attends three group sessions, which are delivered over approximately three weeks. Each session lasts between 60-90 minutes and is conducted in person at a designated location in Addis Ababa. The sessions aim to address the psychological and social impacts of leprosy, focusing on reducing symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression while enhancing social support. Sessions are facilitated by a pair, consisting of a mental health professional and a peer with lived experience of leprosy. The facilitators use a detailed protocol and checklist, ensuring consistency and effectiveness in the delivery of the intervention. <br><br>Control Group<br>Participants in the control group are placed on a waitlist and do not receive the TSR intervention during the active phase of the study.

The length of each incision will be about 7-8 cm. After the skin incision anterior to the medial malleolus the saphenous nerve will be identified, which runs alongside the great saphenous vein. Two branches of the saphenous nerve (anterior and posterior) will be dissected and freed from the surrounding fascia for a length of 7 cm. At this level, both the branches contain 5–6 fascicles. The second skin incision will be made posterior to the medial malleolus where the posterior tibial nerve will be identified in the grove between the medial malleolus and the Achilles tendon after cutting the flexor retinaculum, it will be dissected for a length of about 5 cm. An epi-neural incision of the posterior tibial nerve will be made and 5-6 sensory fascicles will be identified using intra-operative electric stimulation.

The search for affordable alternative treatments has been increasing and, in this sense, the use of natural compounds is being widely explored in the treatment of these injuries, due to their low cost when compared to synthetic medicines. Among the products, propolis has stood out for its healing properties. Brazilian green propolis has shown a significant difference in its chemical composition in relation to other propolis and has therefore become an object of great interest among scientists. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the healing activity of HUMANITAS green propolis ointment in patients with lower limb ulcers resulting from leprosy. Method: The blind and randomized clinical study CAAE: 48002021.0.0000.5514, was carried out at the wound outpatient clinic of the Humanitas Philanthropic Association São Jerônimo da Serra/PR/Brazil, and included the analysis of 18 wounds randomly divided into two groups: propolis ointment G1 and G2 control. The treatment lasted 61 days and patients were evaluated weekly, resulting in 9 evaluations (A0-A8). As assessment instruments, the tracing technique for morphometry and the application of the PUSH scale were used to monitor the evolution and characteristics of the wound. Result: As a result, no participant showed sensitivity to the active ingredient, there was better activity in G1 during the initial phase of treatment, corresponding to the inflammatory and proliferative phases of the healing process and reduction of the lesion area, reduction of inflammatory exudate and formation of a tissue of more revitalized granulation. Conclusion: the use of propolis ointment is safe and promotes tissue repair.","The sample size was composed of 9 patients cured of the lepromatous disease, 7 men and 2 women. The mean age of patients is 64.3 years, ranging from 56 to 72 years, and the mean time that patients had the wound was 7.6 years, ranging from 1 to 20 years. In total, 18 wounds of these 9 patients were treated, which were divided randomly into propolis ointment group - G1 investigational composed of 5 patients and control ointment group - G2 composed of 4 patients. The research participants were residents of the cities surrounding the study site",Participants did not experience adverse events,"As a result of measuring the wound using the tracing technique, it was possible to observe a gradual decrease in the average percentage of the lesion area in both research groups, throughout the entire treated period. However, it was noted that in G1 there was a significant difference, assessed by p-value, in the percentage of area reduction in relation to the G2 group in weeks 1 to 6, and this difference was quite pronounced during the first two weeks of treatment",No,No patient data will be disclosed.,No,False,

About 26 million people worldwide annually have a diabetic foot ulcer with another 130 million at risk of diabetic neuropathy. Though the actual burden of ulcers in leprosy is unknown, it is estimated that over 3 million people are living with disability due to leprosy and that 20-50% of patients with peripheral neuropathy due to leprosy will experience ulcers.<br><br>The prevalence of diabetes is 8.4% in India and 8.5% in Nepal. These figures are higher than the global prevalence of 6.3%. About one-third of diabetic patients develop foot ulcers in their lifetime. While the lifetime incidence of foot ulcers in leprosy is not known, an ongoing cross-sectional study on the prevalence of disabilities due to leprosy has shown that over 30% of patients with an anesthetic foot presented with a plantar ulcer. Foot ulcers reduce patient mobility, social interaction, and health-related quality of life. The treatment of foot ulcers increases the substantial burden on healthcare. Therefore, proper management and expedited healing of foot ulcers are important to limit the burden of ulcer care.<br><br>Challenges in the management of plantar ulcers in leprosy and diabetes<br>The role of pressure on the sole of the foot in the pathogenesis of neuropathic plantar ulcers is well established. Continued pressure over the vulnerable site leads to ulcers and then impedes ulcer healing. Therefore, in addition to removing any infection, an effective way to promote the healing of ulcers is rest - either complete bed rest, which is rarely possible or, commonly, rest to the affected part using an off-loading method.

Access to national virtual servers (Ethiopia, Mozambique, Tanzania) is limited to those authorized by institutional research coordinators. Hard copy data are maintained at field sites in secure locations, and for backup and analysis purposes securely transferred from the national virtual server by accessing a virtual machine hosted by Erasmus MC and cut-off from the internet. To ensure privacy and confidentiality, a data pseudonymisation system (participant ID codes) is in place, and personal identifiers (i.e. names) are not entered in the national virtual server or centralised database. Project staff are trained in privacy and confidentiality. Restricted access to the database is implemented using a secure system to prevent unauthorised access. Qualitative data collected in the supporting studies are kept confidential. Interviews, observations, and focus group data are reported only by generic identifying characteristics, (i.e. age).

Significant effects were observed for group, time, and their interaction, with moderate to large effect sizes. Sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the findings. The training module is recommended for future use to enhance leprosy detection and reduce cases in Malaysia.","There were total of 150 HCWs from 6 districts who worked in primary healthcare clinics that enrolled in this study with 75 HCWs in the intervention group and another 75 HCWs in the control group. The majority of HCWs were female (80%), Malay ethnicity (96.7%), married (82%) and aged 40 years and below (82.7%). For occupation, community nurses (37.3%) were the highest HCWs involved in this study followed by staff nurses (32%) and the majority of HCWs were a diploma background (72%). Half of HCWs had serviced for about 10 years and below. About 51 HCWs (34%) had seen leprosy cases before. Only 8 HCWs (5.3%) had been trained in leprosy training except LaKAR where 7 of them had been trained less than 3 times. Additionally, only 6 HCWs (4%) had seen leprosy cases before and 3 of them had seen more than 3 leprosy patients. Overall, characteristics between the treatment and control groups showed no significant difference between them, and most of the HCWs were distributed well across the group study.The mean score for knowledge was 11.96 in the intervention group and 11.87 in the control group. The overall mean score for knowledge of leprosy among HCWs is 11.91. There were no significant mean differences between the intervention group and the control group for knowledge of leprosy. Moreover, the overall median score for skills of leprosy was 12.00 (7,21). The median score for skills of leprosy in the intervention group was 10.00 (6,22) and 14.00 (11,20) in the control group. There were also no significant median differences between the intervention group and the control group for skills of leprosy at the baseline.",Only 2 HCWs were unable to follow up where 1 HCW in the control group and 1 HCW in the intervention group. One participant in the control group was lost to follow-up due to confinement. An additional participant in the intervention group was lost to follow up at the intervention program as the participant applied for leave for 2 months due to personal reasons. Only a 1.3% dropout rate at the end of study follow-up in the control and intervention groups.,"Knowledge scoreThe mean score for knowledge was 11.96 in the intervention group and 11.87 in the control group. The overall mean score for knowledge of leprosy among HCWs is 11.91. There were no significant mean differences between the intervention group and control group for knowledge of leprosy. There were improvements in both groups for knowledge of leprosy post-intervention. The intragroup mean difference for knowledge of leprosy in the intervention group and control group were 5.82 (48.7%) and 3.05 (25.7%) respectively and both were statistically significant differences. The intervention group significantly showed greater improvement post-intervention with an intergroup difference of 1.48 (48.5%).Skills scoreThe overall median score for skills of leprosy was 12.00 (7,21). The median score for skills of leprosy in the intervention group and control group were 10.00 (6,22) and 14.00 (11,20) respectively. There were no significant median differences between the intervention group and control group for skills of leprosy at the baseline. There were also improvements in both groups for skills of leprosy post-intervention. The intragroup median difference for skills of leprosy in the intervention group and control group were 35.47 (354.7%) and 18.00 (128.6%) respectively and both were statistically significant differences. In the analysis between the intervention and control group (intergroup), a positive median difference score indicates a greater improvement in the intervention group as compared to the control group. The intervention group showed significantly greater improvement with an intergroup median difference of 17.47 (97.1%).Magnitude effects of intervention on knowledge and skills of leprosy The result revealed a significant main effect for the group, time, and the interaction of the group with time for leprosy-related knowledge. Similarly, the findings of an analysis on skills scores also showed a significant main effect for the group, time, and the interaction of the group with time. Partial eta squared and Cohen d were the measures of effect size. In this study, the effect size was found to be moderate or medium to larger effect using partial eta squared and Cohen d for both knowledge and skills of leprosy.Sensitivity analysisOur study performed sensitivity analysis by comparing the results obtained from the complete data analysis, excluding cases with missing values (Per Protocol), with the primary analysis that employed the Intention to Treat (ITT) analysis using the mean substitution method. Surprisingly, both analyses yielded similar outcomes, indicating that the effect sizes measured using partial eta square and Cohen&#039;s d were statistically significant for the two outcome variables. This consistent pattern of results demonstrates the robustness of the findings.",No,prohibited from regulation in contract,No,False,

The median age of patients was 86 years (77-97 years) with 6 males (54.5%) and 5 females (45.5%) of sex. The leprosy type was 10 MB (90.9%) and PB was 1 (9.1%). The median age of onset of leprosy was 12 years (5-16 years) and the median age of cure was 51 years (22-58 years, 3 cases unknown).

One of the conditions for discontinuation of the study, """"the development of three cases of infection or unexplained corneal opacity,"""" did not occurred.","The primary endpoint was improvement in neurotrophic keratopathy, but improvement was judged when one or more of the following two items were satisfied. In the case of corneal epithelial defects, it is the disappearance of corneal epithelial defects from the time of the start of treatment, and in the case of corneal stromal thinning, it is an increase in corneal thickness from the time of treatment initiation. The disappearance of corneal epithelial defects was evaluated based on the area of the epithelial injury, and the increase in corneal thickness in the thin corneal area was evaluated by the thickness of the corneal stroma of the injured area.Improvement in neurotrophic keratopathy was determined in 11 patients, improvement in 10 patients, and no improvement in 1 case.  The rate of improvement in neurotrophic keratopathy was calculated by including discontinuation cases in the denominator of the improvement rate, and was calculated to be 83.3% (90% confidence interval 56.2%~97.0%). The null improvement rate was tested as 15% and was significant with p < 0.00001. Secondary endpoint1. Visual acuityThe mean value (90% confidence interval) of naked-eye visual acuity varies by -0.23 (-0.40, -0.07) from the time of enrollment to the end of follow-up, and the mean value of corrected visual acuity (90% confidence interval) is -0.16 (-0.29, -0.03) changed. According to the one-sample t-test, the change in visual acuity was statistically significantly improved at both 0 to significance levels of 10% on both sides.2. Subjective symptomsSubjective symptoms are: 1 bad, 2 somewhat worse, 3 normal, 4 somewhat better, 5 It is rated on a 5-point scale of good. These five levels were considered a continuous quantities and were aggregated by evaluation period. On average, there was a trend toward """"good"""" as the number of days passed after registration.Analysis by mixed ordered logistic regression estimated that the odds ratio (90% confidence interval) per week after enrollment was 1.18 (1.09, 1.29). This means that there is a 18% probability that subjective symptoms will increase by 1 unit (transition in a positive direction) for each week, and a statistically significant improvement in subjective symptoms was observed over time (P = 0.001).3.Time to Healing of Corneal Epithelial DefectThe time to healing of corneal epithelial defect was indicated by the time from the start of treatment to the time when the epithelial injured area first disappeared.

Children in both treatment groups were visited at school to confirm their identification details and their arms were examined for BCG scars. Ascertainment of cases was through the tuberculosis control programme. Cases notified were reviewed independently by two chest physicians, who classified cases into confirmed (microbiological confirmation), probable (would treat based on the information from the records), suspected (no information in the record suggested this was not tuberculosis) and not tuberculosis (excluded from the analysis), and into pulmonary and non-pulmonary forms. A third specialist reviewed those classified differently by the two chest physicians. The validation was blind to vaccination. <br><br>Cases were linked to the study population in the study database. Linkage was done blind to vaccination status, based on the name of the child, the name of the mother, the sex and date of birth of the child. All possible matches were reviewed by a member of the study team to assess its reliability. Most were unique matches, with complete concordance on all variables. Home visits to a sample of cases not linked to the database identified only two cases (out of 144 visited) that belonged to the database. <br><br>Active informed consent was not obtained. This was because both intervention (BCG revaccination) and absence of intervention were in routine practice in different settings in Brazil at the time, and therefore an """"opt out"""" form of consent was deemed acceptable: parents of children in schools allocated to vaccination were given written information about the va",1.

Both the researcher, who conducted the delivery of the capsules and analysis of the outcomes, and the participants were not aware of the allocation of groups. Experimental groups: Coconut oil group: 13 individuals with lower limb lymphedema, living in an endemic area of lymphatic filariasis, received supplemental capsules (orally) of extra virgin coconut oil. The daily dose was 6g (fractionated into 3 times/day) and the period of use was 70 days. Medium-chain triglycerides (TCM) group: 13 individuals with lower limb lymphedema, living in an endemic area of lymphatic filariasis, received capsules for supplementation (oral use) of TCM oil. The daily dose was 6g (fractionated into 3 times/day) and the period of use was 70 days. Control group: 12 individuals with lower limb lymphedema, living in an endemic area of lymphatic filariasis, received soybean oil supplementation capsules (orally). The daily dose was 6g (fractionated into 3 times/day) and the period of use was 70 days. The capsules used were filled by a pharmacist not connected to the research group, in identical plastic containers, distinguished from each other only by the coding inserted on the label. The capsules had the same color, shape and size, and the bottles were delivered sealed to prevent possible characteristic odors from being exhaled. The meaning of the label encodings was not revealed to the participants or the research group until all data had been collected and analyzed. In this way, researchers and volunteers were blinded to the types of supplements. The","Expected outcome 1: To evaluate the effect of using source oils of medium-chain fatty acids (extra virgin coconut oil and medium-chain triglyceride oil - TCM oil) on the evolution of lymphedema, verified by perimetry of the affected limb, of lower limbs of resident patients in endemic areas for lymphatic filariasis;Outcome found 1: Extra virgin coconut oil was effective in the involution of lymphedema in the study patients. Monitoring the perimetry of the affected limb (over the 70 days of intervention) showed a reduction in measurements that measure the magnitude of lymphedema at different points (foot, leg, knee and thigh). TCM oil did not promote a significant reduction in lymphedema","Expected outcome 2: Evaluate the effect of the intervention on the participants&apos; nutritional status and adiposity, using anthropometric parameters (weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio and hip circumference) and body composition (water, mass lean, fat percentage, body fat index (FMI) and android to gynoid fat ratio);Outcome found 2: In participants who received extra virgin coconut oil: there was a reduction in BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio, hip circumference, body fat percentage and body fat index. In addition, there was an increase in the percentage of fat-free mass. In participants who received TCM oil: there was a reduction in body weight, BMI values, waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio, hip circumference and body fat percentage. In addition, there was an increase in the percentage of fat-free mass;Expected outcome 3: Evaluate the effect of supplementation on the biochemical parameters of metabolism and inflammation in the evaluated patients, using the following dosages: complete blood count, fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol and fractions, triglycerides, albumin, total proteins, ferritin, vitamin B12, vitamin D, protein C-reactive, TNF alpha, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-17;Outcome found 3: No unfavorable changes in lipoproteins associated with atherogenesis and increased cardiometabolic risk were identified in any study group. On the contrary, TCM oil led to a reduction in VLDL and TG levels. And, the modulation exerted on inflammatory markers was due to the elevation of IL-2 and IL-4 levels in patients who received TCM oil. There was a probable trend towards the reduction of pro-inflammatory markers such as TNF-alpha and CRP in all groups;Expected outcome 4: Evaluate the influence of the intervention on the participants&apos; perception of quality of life, using the abbreviated instrument for assessing quality of life - WHOQOL-bref, developed by the World Health Organization. The WHOQOL-bref consists of 26 questions, the first referring to quality of life in general and the second, satisfaction with one&apos;s own health. The remaining 24 questions are translated into facets and cover the physical, psychological, social relations and environment domains;Outcome found 4: The group that received supplementation with extra virgin coconut oil evolved with an improvement in the perception of quality of life and health, characterized by self-perception of quality of life and level of individual satisfaction with health. There was also an improvement in the physical domain of quality of life, determined by the perception of the condition of pain and discomfort, energy and fatigue, sleep and rest, mobility, activities of daily living, dependence on medication or treatments and work ability. Those who received TCM oil did not demonstrate a significant improvement in quality of life. With regard to the facets of the psychological and social relations domains, the average of the values characterized all the study groups with regular quality of life, that is, that needs to be improved;Expected outcome 5: Evaluate the existing correlation between the evolution of lymphedema, throughout the proposed intervention, with the changes in the distribution parameters of body components, through models of Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE);Outcome found 5: Extra virgin coconut oil was effective in the involution of lymphedema in the study patients. In addition, there was a positive association between body mass index (BMI) and body fat index (FMI) with thigh perimetry measurements, throughout the intervention, regardless of gender, age, economic class and physical activity level of the participants. And, in the case of the Baumgartner Index, extra virgin coconut oil showed a negative association with lymphedema, so that each increment in the Baumgartner Index unit led to a reduction in perimetry measurements at different points on the leg and thigh. Thus, although all groups (extra virgin coconut oil, MCT oil and soy oil - control) showed a positive association between BMI and the increase in limb circumference measurements, in the group that received extra virgin coconut oil it was It is evident that adiposity, and not just total body mass, had an effect on the extent of lymphedema. Since there was a negative association of the Baumgartner Index, which assesses appendicular lean mass, with the perimetry measurements analyzed",,Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico - CNPq,Instituto Aggeu Magalhães - Fiocruz Pernambuco,Approved;Approved,15/09/2020;12/01/2021,Comitê de Ética em Pesquisa;Comitê de Ética em Pesquisa,"Av.

This study aims to investigate the effect of MCT supplementation on nutritional, metabolic and quality of life parameters in patients with lower limb lymphedema. For this purpose, the participants receivednutritional assistance and were submitted to an assessment of their body composition and determination of their biochemical profile. The assessment of quality of life will occur by applying the WHOQOL BREF (WHO) test. As for the experimental groups, patients were randomly divided according to nutritional supplementation into 3 groups: TCM 100% Group, Coconut Oil Group and Soybean Oil Group - Control. For the evaluation of body composition were used: densitometry by double emission X-ray, bioelectrical impedance and summation of skinfolds. A significance level of 5% was adopted for all tests. All analyzes were performed using Stata 14.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, USA). The use of vegetable oils source of TCM associated with nutritional monitoring promoted a reduction in body mass index, waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio and hip circumference, and an increase in fat-free mass. In addition, extra virgin coconut oil acted in the modulation of adiposity in different evaluation parameters. The modulation exerted on inflammatory markers was due to the elevation of IL-2 and IL-4 levels in patients who received TCM oil. Extra virgincoconut oil was effective in the involution of lymphedema in the patients in this study. In addition, it promoted an improvement in the quality of life in different domains. Nutritional monitoring and supplementation, instituted here, had beneficial effects both in metabolic variables and in the extent of lymphedema, as well as in the perception of quality of life. This integrates the care proposal for patients with lymphedema and favors the individual capacity to exercise citizenship.","The research was carried out at the Outpatient Clinic of the National Reference Service for Filariasis (SRNF) of the Aggeu Magalhães Institute (IAM) of the Oswaldo Cruz de Pernambuco Foundation (Fiocruz – PE), located in the Northeast Region of Brazil, State of Pernambuco. The population analyzed was composed of patients with lymphedema of the lower limbs registered at the outpatient clinic - IAM/Fiocruz-PE. The sample was established by convenience sampling, with an initial estimate of 60 patients over a period of one year, from both genders, aged between 18 and 85 years, with lower limb lymphedema. The diagnosis of lymphedema was made by doctors from that service, based on clinical assessment and the classification criteria of Dreyer et al. (2002). Recruitment was carried out via phone call or in person at the outpatient clinic. The patients underwent an individual interview with clarifications about the objectives, duration and methodological procedures of the research. Clear information was given and details on how nutritional care and monitoring would take place, the proposed nutritional supplementation, the need to carry out biochemical tests and the methods of assessing body composition that would be adopted (double emission X-ray densitometry (DEXA), bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA ) and sum of skinfolds). Patients were informed about the benefits and possible risks inherent to participating in the study. Once they agreed to participate, they signed the free and informed consent form, also counting on two witnesses not related to the research group.","Possible risks inherent to the study: Questions carried out in the nutritional anamnesis, as well as the socioeconomic characterization of the participants and the anthropometric assessment could have caused some discomfort or embarrassment, which was minimized by the fact that the interview/service was conducted by a qualified professional, in an appropriate environment, on an individual basis. The risks inherent in carrying out biochemical tests, such as pain, bruises and/or local discomfort, were minimal, as the collection was carried out by employees qualified in phlebotomy belonging to the Fiocruz-PE outpatient clinic. Regarding double emission X-ray densitometry (DEXA), the patient received an extremely low amount of radiation, reaching values below 6.7 to 31 uSV. To understand the magnitude of these values, it can be compared with 1000 uSV (tomography) or 60 to 200 uSV (radiographic examination). In addition to the low dose of radiation, the exam was carried out in the shortest possible time to minimize this exposure, which did not reflect a potentially harmful risk to patients. DEXA is a technique widely used in clinical practice to determine body compartments (bone mass, muscle mass and fat mass). The detailed body composition assessment informed participants about possible imbalances in the amount of fat and lean mass body, these findings were monitored by the research nutritionist. And the biochemical evaluation provided current knowledge of the lipid and inflammatory profile of the participants. When any changes were identified in biochemical tests, patients were treated by the Fiocruz-PE medical team or referred to various medical specialties for investigation and clinical treatment.","GROUPS: GTC (TCM oil group), GOC (extra virgin coconut oil group), GC (control group). At the beginning of the study, the groups were homogeneous, with differences between them only for the variables age (p=0.045) and income (p=0.018), with the GOC being composed of older individuals and the GTC and GOC with higher monthly income. . Although the GOC had a higher mean level of vitamin B12 (p=0.047), all groups were within reference values. IL-10 levels were at the limit of statistical difference (p=0.050) also for the CG. The mean for quality of life domain 4 was higher in the GTC and GOC groups (p=0.029), however, it is within the same numerical classification range as the other groups - quality of life “in need of improvement”. At the end of the study, the groups remained homogeneous, with differences being found in hemoglobin (p=0.038) and hematocrit (p=0.043) levels, with lower values in the GOC. In relation to data on anthropometric and body composition variables, evaluated by different methods, in the pre and post supplementation period. It is observed that there was a reduction in weight (p&lt;0.001) and Body Mass Index (BMI) (p&lt;0.001) assessed by anthropometry, fat percentage (p=0.025) and Body Fat Index (FMI) (p=0.028 ) assessed by DEXA and increase in the percentage of lean mass (p=0.026), also assessed by DEXA, among patients in the CG. In relation to GOC patients, there was a reduction in BMI values (p=0.048), waist circumference (WC) (0.029), waist-to-height ratio (WHR) (p=0.027), hip circumference (HC) (p= 0.014), fat percentage (p=0.015) assessed by sum of skinfolds and FMI (p=0.033) assessed by DEXA. Furthermore, there was an increase in the percentage of fat-free mass (FFM) (p=0.019), verified by a predictive equation (Durnin; Womersley, 1974). In GTC patients, reductions in weight (p=0.001), BMI (p=0.001), WC (p=0.013), WHR (p=0.012), HC (p=0.016) and fat percentage (p&lt; 0.001) evaluated by the sum of skinfolds, an increase in the FFM percentage (p&lt;0.001) was also found, verified by a predictive equation (Durnin; Womersley, 1974). Regarding biochemical data referring to the pre- and post-supplementation period, according to the experimental group, patients in the CG showed an increase in the concentrations of total proteins (p=0.045), IL-2 (0.026) and IL-4 (0.004) and reduction in leukocyte levels, however, the average values presented before and after supplementation were within the white blood cell count reference values. GOC patients showed an increase in IL-2 concentration (p=0.004) and a reduction in hemoglobin (p=0.014) and hematocrit (p=0.03) levels. While GTC patients had a reduction in the concentrations of VLDL (p=0.017) and triglycerides (0.044), in addition to an increase in the concentrations of IL-2 (p=0.032) and IL-4 (p=0.043). No unfavorable changes in lipoproteins associated with atherogenesis and increased cardiometabolic risk were identified in any group of this study. GC patients showed an improvement in quality of life in relation to the psychological domain (p=0.036). An improvement in the perception of quality of life and health (p=0.010) and quality of life in relation to the physical domain (p=0.034) was also observed among GOC patients. GTC did not demonstrate an improvement in quality of life. Characterization of the perimetry of the limb affected by lymphedema: measurements were taken every 7 centimeters from the zero point (located at the knee). The measurements taken on the thigh were taken from bottom to top, that is, from point zero to the root of the thigh. The measurements taken on the leg were taken from top to bottom, that is, from point zero to the malleolus. The involution of lymphedema occurred in the GOC. There was a reduction in the perimeters 28 of the thigh (p=0.039), 21 of the thigh (0.021), 14 of the thigh (0.031), 7 of the thigh (0.027), knee (p=0.027), 14 of the leg (p=0.013), 21 of the leg (0.028), 28 of the leg (0.007) and malleolus (0.020). Patients in the GC and GTC who did not show a significant reduction in lymphedema. Extra virgin coconut oil was effective in reversing lymphedema in the patients in this study (GOC) and it was evident that adiposity, and not just total body mass, had an effect on the extent of lymphedema. Furthermore, it promoted an improvement in the quality of life in different areas. ",No,,No,False,

The training involved the identification and management of common impairments and teaching self-care to affected participants. In addition, HCWs received guidance on measuring and recording impairments (for example, ulcer size, size of swelling, and limitations of movement) during participants’ baseline and follow-up visits at the health service. Six HCWs (who were community health extension workers and community health officers) from four primary health centres in the study sites were trained in integrated morbidity management and disability prevention for skin NTDs.<br><br>        b) HCWs’ provision of health education about NTDs and teaching participants with NTD self-care skills on how to manage their own impairments at home.

Two experienced MD?s (urologist and ultrasonographer) will perform the aspiration together under aseptic conditions in a hospital. To avoid traumata during aspiration (lesions of the testis or intra-scrotal vessels) a disposable needle guide will be affixed to the ultrasound transducer by a clamp. This device will help the urologist to aid in positioning the needle to impede that the needle/drainage tube gets too close to the testis and scrotal vessels and therefore prevents unwanted bleeding or lesions of the tunica vaginalis parietalis and visceralis and the testis. Skin disinfectant and sterile ultrasound gel will be used to prevent infection due to exogenous bacteria. The total amount of fluid surrounding the testis will be obtained. 24 hours after aspiration participants will be visited and scanned again for safety reasons to make sure that no bleeding or infection occurred.

The disease is contracted through the bite of an infected blackfly of the genus Simulium, which transmits third-stage infective larvae. An estimated 18 million people suffer from onchocerciasis, with 99% cases in 31 African countries, and 187 million people at risk Onchocercal dermatitis is the most common symptom of the disease, but severe visual impairment and blindness are the most severe complication, and onchocerciasis is the world’s second-leading infectious cause of blindness. Programs for the treatment and control of onchocerciasis through mass drug administration of ivermectin have been in place for over 20 years. However, they require patients to be given treatment (ivermectin) at regular intervals for the life of the adult worm (up to 15 years), making implementation extremely difficult in endemic countries.

In each setting, groups of volunteers will be dermally exposed to single-sex (male) cercariae once at doses of between 10 and 30 cercariae. Depending on the outcome of the low dose infection, the dose will be escalated or additional volunteers will be exposed to the same number of cercariae. Volunteers will undergo intensive follow-up for 24 weeks and a late follow-up time point at 52 weeks. They will visit the clinical trial centre weekly after infection for 12 weeks. After this, two-weekly visits will continue until week 24. A final follow up visit will be after one year. During the visits, adverse events will be recorded, levels of Schistosoma mansoni circulating anodic antigen (CAA) will be measured and samples obtained for immunological analyses. Immediately CAA is detected (expected around 6 to 8 weeks after infection) the volunteers will be treated with praziquantel to cure the Schistosoma infection. Praziquantel may be repeated 4 weeks later if CAA levels do not fall to zero. Volunteers will be required to avoid contact with potentially Schistosoma mansoni-contaminated water until the controlled infection has been shown to have been effectively cured, potentially a period of up to 14 weeks. The trial is estimated to last 30 months.","1.

We examined the impact of a combination of human mass chemotherapy, snail control through mollusciciding and SjCTPI bovine vaccination on the human incidence of infection. Following the baseline survey, the interventions were implemented in 18 intervention groups from 2013 to 2017. The investigators, including the research team, and study participants were blind to the vaccine allocation. At baseline all residents (60 mg/kg directly observed split oral dose) and bovines (30 mg/kg directly feed oral dose) were treated with a directly observed oral dose of PZQ.

Patients with a known allergy for Pentamidine Isethionate.<br>","The disease leishmaniasis, caused by protozoan Leishmania parasites and transmitted via infectedfemale sandflies and reservoir hosts is endemic in 88 countries and 350 million people are at risk. Leishmaniasis prevalence is >12 million cases/year and the incidence is >2.5 million cases/year. The estimated disease burden is 2.4 million DALYs. Leishmaniasis is a category 1 disease (Emerging or uncontrolled diseases) and the World Health Organization (WHO) has acknowledged it as a severely neglected disease and urged intensified research programs to improve vector control, diagnostics and therapeutic arsenal to contain further incidence and morbidity.An infection with Leishmania parasites can, depending of the infecting species, give rise to several distinct clinical manifestations, ranging from localized cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) with single to multiple skin ulcers, satellite lesions or nodular lymphangitis or possibly mucosal involvement and systemic visceral leishmaniasis (VL) with involvement of different organs (like liver and spleen) and bone marrow, which may be lethal. Currently, Pentamidine isethionate is the only drug available for patients with CL in Suriname. Usual care at this moment in Suriname entails a standard treatment regimen of three doses of 4mg/kg body weight Pentamidine Isethionate im. (in 7 days)","In this project, Pentamidine Isethionate treatment will be studied in a randomized controlled trial with 2 treatment arms: <br /><br>1. 4mg/kg body weight im. at day 1, 4 and 7 (control / usual care arm) or <br /><br>2. a short course regime of 7mg/kg body weight im. on day 1 and day 3 (case/ intervention arm).<br /><br>Assuming remission rates of 10% under both treatments, a sample size of 100 patients in each treatment arm was calculated to achieve an 80% power to yield a statistical significant result. Due to an expected 10% dropout in both arms, we aim to enroll a total of 220 patients, with 110 in the usual intervention arm and 110 in the short intervention arm. <br /><br>Considering side effects of treatment, in the control arm these are rarely seen. In the case arm with higher dosage in shorter time, it will be interesting to compare this with the control arm.<br>","To establish if a short course pentamidine isethionate 7 mg/kg body weight given intramuscular at days 1 and 3 (short course) is equally effective as the standard course pentamidine isethionate 4mg/kg intramuscular at days 1, 4 and 7 (standard course) in patients with CL. CL is diagnosed by the detection of leishmaniasis organisms (in a skin smear or a biopsy by light microscope or by the detection of leishmaniasis nucleic acid sequences through NAAT) in a clinically suspected lesion. <br><br /><br /><br>1. A clinical relapse is defined as persistence of one or more leishmaniasis lesions at 6 or 12 weeks after completion of treatment documented by one dermatologist with at least 4 years diagnostic experience in leishmaniasis. All lesions will be photographed (both healed and persisting lesions) and evaluated per visit by a second dermatologist with at least 4 years diagnostic experience in leishmaniasis, who is blinded from the results of the first evaluator. In case of discrepancy between the 2 dermatologist observers, the discrepancy will be solved by a third dermatologist with at least 4 years diagnostic experience in leishmaniasis on the basis of the photographs of the discrepant lesions. The expected success of the standard treatment group is approximately 90%10. To determine whether the treatment success of the short course is equal to that of the standard course, no less than an expected 70% treatment success is considered effective. <br /><br>2. To establish if the short course is equally effective as the standard course as far as parasitological cure rate 6 and 12 weeks after completion of the treatment. A parasitological cure is defined as elimination of leishmania RNA 6 and 12 weeks after completion of the treatment course, in one designated proven leishmania RNA positive lesion before treatment. The short course is considered to have an equal parasitological cure rate, if in the short course arm the rate does not exceed the cure rate in the standard course arm by more than 20% (compared per visit).<br>","1. To establish if the short course has an equal rate of patient reported side effects and clinically determined drug related toxicity events as the standard course. <br>Side effects (recorded at the last treatment visit) are: <br /><br>a. nausea (as indicated by the patient);<br /><br>b. erythema exsudativum multiforme (occurrence of blisters in skin and/or mucosal tissue);<br /><br>c. unknown/other side effects.<br /> <br>Drug related toxicity events (recorded 1 week after treatment and compared to the screenings visit) are: <br /><br>d. hypotension (10mm Hg drop in diastolic blood pressure compared to: the pressure before the injection, measured halfway the injection and 10 minutes after the injection);<br /> <br>e. hemolysis (>1mmol drop in hemoglobin count);<br /> <br>f. leucopenia (drop in leukocytes count < 4 x 10(9)/l);<br /> <br>g. thrombocytopenia (drop in thrombocytes < 150 x 10(9)/l);<br /><br>h. hypoglycemia (drop in glucose < 4 mmol/l);<br /> <br>i. liver toxicity (>2 fold rise in serum transaminases, normal values = <40 U/l));<br /><br>j. nefrotoxicity (kreatinin level rise >10umol/l, normal values = 70-110 umol/l));<br /> <br>k. pancreas toxicity (3 fold rise in amylase, normal value = 32 U/l)). <br /><br>The short course is considered to have an equal rate of side effects or drug related drug toxicity events if in the short course arm the rate does not exceed the rate in the standard course arm by more 20%. <br /><br>2. To establish if the short course is equal to the standard course as far as health related quality of life measured by validated self-report questionnaires. Generic QoL measured by the EQ-5D and EQ-VAS questionnaires and disease-specific QoL measured by the SKINDEX questionnaire. The short course is considered to affect the quality of life equally as the standard course if the quality of life outcome in the short course arm is no lower than the quality of life outcomes in the standard course group by more than 20%. <br /><br>3. To establish if the short course is equal to the standard course as far as the cost-effectiveness based on a cost survey questionnaire. The appropriate type of economic evaluation is conditional on the results of the primary objective (relapse rate) and health related quality-of-life (HR-QoL). In the case of one clearly superior strategy, a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) would be required to combine clinical and economic outcomes. In case of comparable outcomes in clinical effectiveness, a cost-minimization analysis (CMA) would suffice.<br /><br>4. To establish the effect on the patient compliance of the short course regimen versus the standard course regimen. A patient is considered non-compliant for a study visit in case he/she fails to show up more than 24 hours after the consented date and time, without a notification beforehand. The short course is considered to affect the compliance compared to the standard course if the compliance rates between the two regimens differs by more than 20%.
