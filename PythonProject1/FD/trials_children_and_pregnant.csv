Children less than 14 years old will be excluded<br>    because of the amount of blood required for the immunologic studies. The age of consent in<br>    Mali is 18 years of age, so children aged 14 to 17 years will sign an assent form in<br>    addition to the consent form to be signed by a parent or tutor. However, married women<br>    between the ages of 14 and 17 will sign consent as adults in view of the laws governing<br>    emancipation of women in Mali.

For this reason, females of<br><br>    childbearing-age must have a negative pregnancy test result prior to receiving<br>    praziquantel. Since the half-life of praziquantel is short (3-4 hours), contraceptive<br>    measures will not be required post-treatment.<br><br>    -Breast feeding: Praziquantel is known to be present in breast milk for up to 3 days<br>    following a single dose and is not approved for use in children under the age of 4 years.<br>    Consequently, women will be asked to suspend breastfeeding after treatment with PZQ for 3<br>    days.

A stable chronic medical condition is defined<br>    as no change in prescription medication, dose, or frequency of medication in the last 3<br>    months (90 days) and health outcomes of the specific disease are considered to be within<br>    acceptable limits in the last 6 months (180 days). Any change due to change of health care<br>    provider, insurance company, or that is done for financial reasons, as long as in the same<br>    class of medication, will not be considered a violation of this inclusion criterion. Any<br>    change in prescription medication due to improvement of a disease outcome, as determined by<br>    the site principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, will not be considered a<br>    violation of this inclusion criterion. Subjects may be on chronic or as needed (prn)<br>    medications if, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or appropriate<br>    sub-investigator, they pose no additional risk to subject safety or assessment of<br>    reactogenicity and immunogenicity.
