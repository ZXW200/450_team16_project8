About 26 million people worldwide annually have a diabetic foot ulcer with another 130 million at risk of diabetic neuropathy. Though the actual burden of ulcers in leprosy is unknown, it is estimated that over 3 million people are living with disability due to leprosy and that 20-50% of patients with peripheral neuropathy due to leprosy will experience ulcers.<br><br>The prevalence of diabetes is 8.4% in India and 8.5% in Nepal. These figures are higher than the global prevalence of 6.3%. About one-third of diabetic patients develop foot ulcers in their lifetime. While the lifetime incidence of foot ulcers in leprosy is not known, an ongoing cross-sectional study on the prevalence of disabilities due to leprosy has shown that over 30% of patients with an anesthetic foot presented with a plantar ulcer. Foot ulcers reduce patient mobility, social interaction, and health-related quality of life. The treatment of foot ulcers increases the substantial burden on healthcare. Therefore, proper management and expedited healing of foot ulcers are important to limit the burden of ulcer care.<br><br>Challenges in the management of plantar ulcers in leprosy and diabetes<br>The role of pressure on the sole of the foot in the pathogenesis of neuropathic plantar ulcers is well established. Continued pressure over the vulnerable site leads to ulcers and then impedes ulcer healing. Therefore, in addition to removing any infection, an effective way to promote the healing of ulcers is rest - either complete bed rest, which is rarely possible or, commonly, rest to the affected part using an off-loading method.

A data management plan was developed, consistent with EU regulation 536/2014 for clinical medication-related research projects. Quantitative data collected is recorded paper-based and entered into the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system. REDCap is linked to a centralised database server hosted by Erasmus MC. Access to national virtual servers (Ethiopia, Mozambique, Tanzania) is limited to those authorized by institutional research coordinators. Hard copy data are maintained at field sites in secure locations, and for backup and analysis purposes securely transferred from the national virtual server by accessing a virtual machine hosted by Erasmus MC and cut-off from the internet. To ensure privacy and confidentiality, a data pseudonymisation system (participant ID codes) is in place, and personal identifiers (i.e. names) are not entered in the national virtual server or centralised database. Project staff are trained in privacy and confidentiality. Restricted access to the database is implemented using a secure system to prevent unauthorised access. Qualitative data collected in the supporting studies are kept confidential. Interviews, observations, and focus group data are reported only by generic identifying characteristics, (i.e. age). Standards for data storage include security (i.e. antivirus/firewalls), regular backups, easy access for authorized users and measures to prevent theft of tablets/laptops/desktops.

The insole will be custom made according to size and shape of the patient feet and location of ulcer, thereby facilitating the distribution of weight over entire foot, except over ulcer area. The custom made insole will be fitted inside the removable walker to off-load the ulcer area. We will cut and remove the part of the insole which is directly below the ulcer area to off-load the pressure. The removable walker is readymade and available in different sizes which can be fitted for varying length and circumference of the leg. The Velcro straps in the removable walker allows to accommodate varying circumference of the leg. Special attention will be paid to ensure the adherence to wearing of the walker. We will educate the patient on importance of adherence to walker and open the walker only for dressing the wound during the self-care teaching.

In addition, HCWs received guidance on measuring and recording impairments (for example, ulcer size, size of swelling, and limitations of movement) during participants’ baseline and follow-up visits at the health service. Six HCWs (who were community health extension workers and community health officers) from four primary health centres in the study sites were trained in integrated morbidity management and disability prevention for skin NTDs.<br><br>        b) HCWs’ provision of health education about NTDs and teaching participants with NTD self-care skills on how to manage their own impairments at home. This involved HCWs working with each participant to identify and care for his/her impairments so that they could manage their own care. The skills taught to participants during monthly visits with HCWs included skin and scar care, wound dressing, guidance on sterilisation of bandages, management of swelling and prevention and ",<br>        1.

We shall also feedback results to patients and communities through hospital staff who see patients on a daily basis. The Leprosy Mission has extensive experience in working with local communities and we will draw on their experience and networks to engage patients and communities within our research. We will present our work at conferences such as the annual conference of the Neglected Tropical Disease, NGDO Network of which The Leprosy Mission is a member, Health Systems Global Conference and the International Leprosy Congress in 2022. Tools we will use to disseminate our research output include bite-sized research reports in lay format; public announcements in communities in LMICs; policy briefings; print and online media; the director’s News Blog (680+ subscribers); and institutional and professional social media accounts and websites. These forums will alert interested parties to our work, and also allow them to communicate with us.",Yes,False,          ,2020.0,12.2

The training involved the identification and management of common impairments and teaching self-care to affected participants. In addition, HCWs received guidance on measuring and recording impairments (for example, ulcer size, size of swelling, and limitations of movement) during participants’ baseline and follow-up visits at the health service. Six HCWs (who were community health extension workers and community health officers) from four primary health centres in the study sites were trained in integrated morbidity management and disability prevention for skin NTDs.<br><br>        b) HCWs’ provision of health education about NTDs and teaching participants with NTD self-care skills on how to manage their own impairments at home.

Two experienced MD?s (urologist and ultrasonographer) will perform the aspiration together under aseptic conditions in a hospital. To avoid traumata during aspiration (lesions of the testis or intra-scrotal vessels) a disposable needle guide will be affixed to the ultrasound transducer by a clamp. This device will help the urologist to aid in positioning the needle to impede that the needle/drainage tube gets too close to the testis and scrotal vessels and therefore prevents unwanted bleeding or lesions of the tunica vaginalis parietalis and visceralis and the testis. Skin disinfectant and sterile ultrasound gel will be used to prevent infection due to exogenous bacteria. The total amount of fluid surrounding the testis will be obtained. 24 hours after aspiration participants will be visited and scanned again for safety reasons to make sure that no bleeding or infection occurred. In case of any aspiration related problem, the responsible urologist and MD will care for the patient until resolution.

In each setting, groups of volunteers will be dermally exposed to single-sex (male) cercariae once at doses of between 10 and 30 cercariae. Depending on the outcome of the low dose infection, the dose will be escalated or additional volunteers will be exposed to the same number of cercariae. Volunteers will undergo intensive follow-up for 24 weeks and a late follow-up time point at 52 weeks. They will visit the clinical trial centre weekly after infection for 12 weeks. After this, two-weekly visits will continue until week 24. A final follow up visit will be after one year. During the visits, adverse events will be recorded, levels of Schistosoma mansoni circulating anodic antigen (CAA) will be measured and samples obtained for immunological analyses. Immediately CAA is detected (expected around 6 to 8 weeks after infection) the volunteers will be treated with praziquantel to cure the Schistosoma infection. Praziquantel may be repeated 4 weeks later if CAA levels do not fall to zero. Volunteers will be required to avoid contact with potentially Schistosoma mansoni-contaminated water until the controlled infection has been shown to have been effectively cured, potentially a period of up to 14 weeks. The trial is estimated to last 30 months.","1.

Patients with a known allergy for Pentamidine Isethionate.<br>","The disease leishmaniasis, caused by protozoan Leishmania parasites and transmitted via infectedfemale sandflies and reservoir hosts is endemic in 88 countries and 350 million people are at risk. Leishmaniasis prevalence is >12 million cases/year and the incidence is >2.5 million cases/year. The estimated disease burden is 2.4 million DALYs. Leishmaniasis is a category 1 disease (Emerging or uncontrolled diseases) and the World Health Organization (WHO) has acknowledged it as a severely neglected disease and urged intensified research programs to improve vector control, diagnostics and therapeutic arsenal to contain further incidence and morbidity.An infection with Leishmania parasites can, depending of the infecting species, give rise to several distinct clinical manifestations, ranging from localized cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) with single to multiple skin ulcers, satellite lesions or nodular lymphangitis or possibly mucosal involvement and systemic visceral leishmaniasis (VL) with involvement of different organs (like liver and spleen) and bone marrow, which may be lethal. Currently, Pentamidine isethionate is the only drug available for patients with CL in Suriname. Usual care at this moment in Suriname entails a standard treatment regimen of three doses of 4mg/kg body weight Pentamidine Isethionate im. (in 7 days)","In this project, Pentamidine Isethionate treatment will be studied in a randomized controlled trial with 2 treatment arms: <br /><br>1. 4mg/kg body weight im. at day 1, 4 and 7 (control / usual care arm) or <br /><br>2. a short course regime of 7mg/kg body weight im. on day 1 and day 3 (case/ intervention arm).<br /><br>Assuming remission rates of 10% under both treatments, a sample size of 100 patients in each treatment arm was calculated to achieve an 80% power to yield a statistical significant result. Due to an expected 10% dropout in both arms, we aim to enroll a total of 220 patients, with 110 in the usual intervention arm and 110 in the short intervention arm. <br /><br>Considering side effects of treatment, in the control arm these are rarely seen. In the case arm with higher dosage in shorter time, it will be interesting to compare this with the control arm.<br>","To establish if a short course pentamidine isethionate 7 mg/kg body weight given intramuscular at days 1 and 3 (short course) is equally effective as the standard course pentamidine isethionate 4mg/kg intramuscular at days 1, 4 and 7 (standard course) in patients with CL. CL is diagnosed by the detection of leishmaniasis organisms (in a skin smear or a biopsy by light microscope or by the detection of leishmaniasis nucleic acid sequences through NAAT) in a clinically suspected lesion. <br><br /><br /><br>1. A clinical relapse is defined as persistence of one or more leishmaniasis lesions at 6 or 12 weeks after completion of treatment documented by one dermatologist with at least 4 years diagnostic experience in leishmaniasis. All lesions will be photographed (both healed and persisting lesions) and evaluated per visit by a second dermatologist with at least 4 years diagnostic experience in leishmaniasis, who is blinded from the results of the first evaluator. In case of discrepancy between the 2 dermatologist observers, the discrepancy will be solved by a third dermatologist with at least 4 years diagnostic experience in leishmaniasis on the basis of the photographs of the discrepant lesions. The expected success of the standard treatment group is approximately 90%10. To determine whether the treatment success of the short course is equal to that of the standard course, no less than an expected 70% treatment success is considered effective. <br /><br>2. To establish if the short course is equally effective as the standard course as far as parasitological cure rate 6 and 12 weeks after completion of the treatment. A parasitological cure is defined as elimination of leishmania RNA 6 and 12 weeks after completion of the treatment course, in one designated proven leishmania RNA positive lesion before treatment. The short course is considered to have an equal parasitological cure rate, if in the short course arm the rate does not exceed the cure rate in the standard course arm by more than 20% (compared per visit).<br>","1. To establish if the short course has an equal rate of patient reported side effects and clinically determined drug related toxicity events as the standard course. <br>Side effects (recorded at the last treatment visit) are: <br /><br>a. nausea (as indicated by the patient);<br /><br>b. erythema exsudativum multiforme (occurrence of blisters in skin and/or mucosal tissue);<br /><br>c. unknown/other side effects.<br /> <br>Drug related toxicity events (recorded 1 week after treatment and compared to the screenings visit) are: <br /><br>d. hypotension (10mm Hg drop in diastolic blood pressure compared to: the pressure before the injection, measured halfway the injection and 10 minutes after the injection);<br /> <br>e. hemolysis (>1mmol drop in hemoglobin count);<br /> <br>f. leucopenia (drop in leukocytes count < 4 x 10(9)/l);<br /> <br>g. thrombocytopenia (drop in thrombocytes < 150 x 10(9)/l);<br /><br>h. hypoglycemia (drop in glucose < 4 mmol/l);<br /> <br>i. liver toxicity (>2 fold rise in serum transaminases, normal values = <40 U/l));<br /><br>j. nefrotoxicity (kreatinin level rise >10umol/l, normal values = 70-110 umol/l));<br /> <br>k. pancreas toxicity (3 fold rise in amylase, normal value = 32 U/l)). <br /><br>The short course is considered to have an equal rate of side effects or drug related drug toxicity events if in the short course arm the rate does not exceed the rate in the standard course arm by more 20%. <br /><br>2. To establish if the short course is equal to the standard course as far as health related quality of life measured by validated self-report questionnaires. Generic QoL measured by the EQ-5D and EQ-VAS questionnaires and disease-specific QoL measured by the SKINDEX questionnaire. The short course is considered to affect the quality of life equally as the standard course if the quality of life outcome in the short course arm is no lower than the quality of life outcomes in the standard course group by more than 20%. <br /><br>3. To establish if the short course is equal to the standard course as far as the cost-effectiveness based on a cost survey questionnaire. The appropriate type of economic evaluation is conditional on the results of the primary objective (relapse rate) and health related quality-of-life (HR-QoL). In the case of one clearly superior strategy, a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) would be required to combine clinical and economic outcomes. In case of comparable outcomes in clinical effectiveness, a cost-minimization analysis (CMA) would suffice.<br /><br>4. To establish the effect on the patient compliance of the short course regimen versus the standard course regimen. A patient is considered non-compliant for a study visit in case he/she fails to show up more than 24 hours after the consented date and time, without a notification beforehand.
