The study aim is to assess a combination of drugs for Chagas disease (CD) therapy, assuming benznidazol (BZ) as the drug of choice plus dissulfiram (DF) as repositioned drug. It is hypothesized that employing the drug of choice with a repositioned one, contributes to the establishment of a new effective, well-tolerated low-cost combination therapy for chronic CD patients. From eligibility confirmation, nine (n = 9) participants will be allocated to the first medication treatment level. The treatment will begin with the lowest dose of BZ for 60 days, corresponding to 100 mg/day associated with 250 mg/day of DF. Upon safety confirmation of the lowest dose of BZ, a new group of 9 patients (group II) will receive a higher dose of BZ (200 mg/day BZ + 250 mg/day DF). After confirming the safety of this dose, another group of 9 patients (group III) will receive the maximum recommended dose of BZ, which is 300 mg/day+250 mg/day DF. Directly after the completion of group III, we will start group IV with 9 others patients receiving the lowest dose of BZ, however associated with 500mg/day of DF. The scheduling scheme will be similar to that previously described for BZ dose progression.

As patients were included in this study, they made over a period of one week a laboratory evaluation including complete blood count, glucose, urea and creatinine, uric acid, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, sodium, calcium and potassium, total proteins and fractions, liver function tests and thyroid, examination of stools and urine analysis for abnormal elements and sediment. These tests were performed throughout this study when clinically required. The first 30 days after inclusion were performed the following tests: the conventional resting ECG with 12 leads, chest x-ray postero-anterior and lateral, one and two dimensional echocardiography and Doppler study of oxidative stress.Similarly, throughout the study, these tests were repeated annually and when they were needed, that is, with the patient's clinical change, except the study of oxidative stress was always performed after the intervention occurred. Antioxidant defenses and oxidative stress biomarkers were measured in the study three times in their respective groups, one before surgery and 2 after carvedilol administration of carvedilol (six months) and then after joint administration of carvedilol with vitamin E and C for another 6 months (carvedilol 12.5 mg, 3 times daily for 6 months, at a dose of 800UI/day vitamin E and 500mg/day vitamin C, single dose for 6 months).<br><br><br><br><br>","Biochemical tests performed to test the antioxidant capacity of the drug carvedilol with / without vitamins E and C were the following: determining the activity of the following antioxidant enzymes: superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase and glutathione reductase.

A diagnosis of cysticercosis was made on the basis of the established diagnostic criteria. Disseminated cysticercosis was defined as the presence of multiple (= 3) cystic viable lesions in the brain, along with evidence of involvement of at least one extra site, like subcutaneous tissues, skeletal muscles, eyes, or presence in any visceral organ.","Exclusion criteria: <br>        1.

Oxcarbazepine at a dose of 10-15 mg/kg/day was used as the first-line antiepileptic drug. If the control over seizures was neither obtained nor oxcarbazepine tolerated, levetiracetam was the next drug prescribed. To aid prompt control of seizures, clobazam was added for the initial 2-3 weeks; it was deemed that appropriate therapeutic levels of oxcarbazepine would have been achieved by this time. The patients were administered albendazole after excluding those with cysticercal encephalitis. In patients with vitreoretinal cysticercosis or cysticercal lesions abutting optic nerve, albendazole was initiated at least 6 weeks after the surgical excision of the cyst. Albendazole was given at a dose of 15 mg/kg/day (given in 2 divided doses). Three days prior to starting albendazole, the patients were primed with oral methylprednisolone (0.75-1 mg/kg of body weight) and it was continued in full dose during the course of albendazole therapy (28 days), followed by tapering in next 2-3 weeks (0.25 mg/kg /week). A total of 3 cycles of albendazole were administered; each cycle was of 28 days and the difference of 3 months between the two evaluations was calculated from the last tapered dose of oral methylprednisolone. The protocol warranted discontinuation of albendazole if any patient developed a rash or an untoward complication like raised intracranial pressure, signs of meningeal irritation, visual disturbances or suggestion of myelitis; oral methylprednisolone, however, was to be continued to manage the complications arising from the release of antigens.

A health educational package was developed with community participation. The intervention package consisted of a training manual, a video programme, two posters, a leaflet and booklet. In the first stage, local livestock/agricultural extension agents and health workers were updated on Taenia solium cysticercosis and taeniosis by the principal investigator, and practised on how to educate smallholder pig farners on the problem. This training lasted for two days, approximately two hours each day. In the second stage, a trained extension agent addressed smallholder pig farmers on Taenia solium using the training manual and posters in a special seminar. Thereafter, seminar participants watched a 14-minute video on Taenia solium. The video was produced locally and acted by the local people. Finally, each participant was given a booklet and a leaflet to take home. Pig farmers' training was a one-day intervention that lasted for approximately two hours. The health education package informed smallholder pig farmers on the mode of transmission, impact, prevention and control of Taenia solium, a zoonotic parasite that was highly prevalent in Mbulu district, northern Tanzania. Pig farmers' education was administered at village level. Assessment of specific knowledge, practices and incidence of porcine cysticercosis was done before the intervention and one to two times after the intervention for a median of 4 months (range: 2-9 months).",Incidence rate of porcine cysticercosis in sentinel pigs (as an indirect measure of the risk of human cysticercosis).

Then, wearing gloves, the leech will be removed. In order to prevent the irritation and irritation of the leech. At first, 10 leeches are placed in the infected areas and the leech treated area is observed and examined for 2 minutes (to check that the leech sticks and sucks blood). If the leech is able to stick and no blood sucking, with a needle, a small incision will be made in the area and the leech will be placed on that area. Then a wet gauze or a transparent plastic cup will be placed on it to provide moisture to the leech's body and prevent the leech from moving.

However, post-intervention, the intervention group showed greater improvement than the control group. Significant effects were observed for group, time, and their interaction, with moderate to large effect sizes. Sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the findings. The training module is recommended for future use to enhance leprosy detection and reduce cases in Malaysia.","There were total of 150 HCWs from 6 districts who worked in primary healthcare clinics that enrolled in this study with 75 HCWs in the intervention group and another 75 HCWs in the control group. The majority of HCWs were female (80%), Malay ethnicity (96.7%), married (82%) and aged 40 years and below (82.7%). For occupation, community nurses (37.3%) were the highest HCWs involved in this study followed by staff nurses (32%) and the majority of HCWs were a diploma background (72%). Half of HCWs had serviced for about 10 years and below. About 51 HCWs (34%) had seen leprosy cases before. Only 8 HCWs (5.3%) had been trained in leprosy training except LaKAR where 7 of them had been trained less than 3 times. Additionally, only 6 HCWs (4%) had seen leprosy cases before and 3 of them had seen more than 3 leprosy patients. Overall, characteristics between the treatment and control groups showed no significant difference between them, and most of the HCWs were distributed well across the group study.The mean score for knowledge was 11.96 in the intervention group and 11.87 in the control group. The overall mean score for knowledge of leprosy among HCWs is 11.91. There were no significant mean differences between the intervention group and the control group for knowledge of leprosy. Moreover, the overall median score for skills of leprosy was 12.00 (7,21). The median score for skills of leprosy in the intervention group was 10.00 (6,22) and 14.00 (11,20) in the control group. There were also no significant median differences between the intervention group and the control group for skills of leprosy at the baseline.",Only 2 HCWs were unable to follow up where 1 HCW in the control group and 1 HCW in the intervention group. One participant in the control group was lost to follow-up due to confinement. An additional participant in the intervention group was lost to follow up at the intervention program as the participant applied for leave for 2 months due to personal reasons. Only a 1.3% dropout rate at the end of study follow-up in the control and intervention groups.,"Knowledge scoreThe mean score for knowledge was 11.96 in the intervention group and 11.87 in the control group. The overall mean score for knowledge of leprosy among HCWs is 11.91. There were no significant mean differences between the intervention group and control group for knowledge of leprosy. There were improvements in both groups for knowledge of leprosy post-intervention. The intragroup mean difference for knowledge of leprosy in the intervention group and control group were 5.82 (48.7%) and 3.05 (25.7%) respectively and both were statistically significant differences. The intervention group significantly showed greater improvement post-intervention with an intergroup difference of 1.48 (48.5%).Skills scoreThe overall median score for skills of leprosy was 12.00 (7,21). The median score for skills of leprosy in the intervention group and control group were 10.00 (6,22) and 14.00 (11,20) respectively. There were no significant median differences between the intervention group and control group for skills of leprosy at the baseline. There were also improvements in both groups for skills of leprosy post-intervention. The intragroup median difference for skills of leprosy in the intervention group and control group were 35.47 (354.7%) and 18.00 (128.6%) respectively and both were statistically significant differences. In the analysis between the intervention and control group (intergroup), a positive median difference score indicates a greater improvement in the intervention group as compared to the control group. The intervention group showed significantly greater improvement with an intergroup median difference of 17.47 (97.1%).Magnitude effects of intervention on knowledge and skills of leprosy The result revealed a significant main effect for the group, time, and the interaction of the group with time for leprosy-related knowledge. Similarly, the findings of an analysis on skills scores also showed a significant main effect for the group, time, and the interaction of the group with time. Partial eta squared and Cohen d were the measures of effect size. In this study, the effect size was found to be moderate or medium to larger effect using partial eta squared and Cohen d for both knowledge and skills of leprosy.Sensitivity analysisOur study performed sensitivity analysis by comparing the results obtained from the complete data analysis, excluding cases with missing values (Per Protocol), with the primary analysis that employed the Intention to Treat (ITT) analysis using the mean substitution method. Surprisingly, both analyses yielded similar outcomes, indicating that the effect sizes measured using partial eta square and Cohen&#039;s d were statistically significant for the two outcome variables.

FGLM-NH2+SSSR eye drops are considered to be effective for neurotrophic keratopathy, which is a sequelae of leprosy, and its ordinary use is strongly desired.","The subjects were patients with neurotrophic keratopathy due to the sequelae of leprosy and were residents of the National Hansen's Disease Sanatorium. 10 (90.9%) of them belonged to Kikuchi Keifuen and 1(9.1%) to Oshima Seishoen. The median age of patients was 86 years (77-97 years) with 6 males (54.5%) and 5 females (45.5%) of sex. The leprosy type was 10 MB (90.9%) and PB was 1 (9.1%). The median age of onset of leprosy was 12 years (5-16 years) and the median age of cure was 51 years (22-58 years, 3 cases unknown). All patients had sensory paralysis and motor nerve paralysis due to leprosy throughout the body, and had sequelae disabilities of limbs such as 5 drop foot, 3 lower limb amputations, and 2 drop hands. Systemic complications included hypertension in 5 cases, reflux esophagitis in 3 cases, cerebral infarction in 3 cases, and diabetes mellitus in 1 case. Age-related osteoarthritis and other complications were observed in many cases. A total of 92 diverse diseases were reported. The target eyes for treatment were 6 (50.0%) right eyes and 6 (50.0%) left eyes, and the presenting symptoms due to neurotrophic keratopathy were prolonged corneal epithelial damage in 3 eyes (25.0%), thinning of the corneal stroma in 7 eyes (58.3%), and a combination of both in 2 eyes (16.7%). A total of 55 for ophthalmic complications were reported in the treated eyes and 28 for ophthalmic history. The most common complication was facial nerve palsy (11 cases), and the most common pre-existing complication was iridocyclitis (9 cases).","There were no adverse events that appeared to be related to the study drug.A total of 38 cases of adverse events were reported, the majority of which were Grade 1 (76.3%), 10.5% were Grade 2, and 5 were Grade 3 (13.2%). Of the Grade 3 adverse events, only one case of """"corneal ulcer"""" was related to the eye, and the causal relationship was """"unknown"""". The outcome was 65.8% recovery, 23.7% minor recovery, and 10.5% non-recovery. Including one case of """"corneal ulcer"""", 5 cases of Grade 3 recovered. The action after adverse events was unchanged in 91.9% of cases and not applicable in 3.1% of cases. 4 patients (10.5%) were serious. Causality was """"not related"""" in 81.6% of cases and """"unknown"""" in 18.4% of cases, and no cases were """"related"""". One of the conditions for discontinuation of the study, """"the development of three cases of infection or unexplained corneal opacity,"""" did not occurred.","The primary endpoint was improvement in neurotrophic keratopathy, but improvement was judged when one or more of the following two items were satisfied. In the case of corneal epithelial defects, it is the disappearance of corneal epithelial defects from the time of the start of treatment, and in the case of corneal stromal thinning, it is an increase in corneal thickness from the time of treatment initiation. The disappearance of corneal epithelial defects was evaluated based on the area of the epithelial injury, and the increase in corneal thickness in the thin corneal area was evaluated by the thickness of the corneal stroma of the injured area.Improvement in neurotrophic keratopathy was determined in 11 patients, improvement in 10 patients, and no improvement in 1 case.  The rate of improvement in neurotrophic keratopathy was calculated by including discontinuation cases in the denominator of the improvement rate, and was calculated to be 83.3% (90% confidence interval 56.2%~97.0%). The null improvement rate was tested as 15% and was significant with p < 0.00001. Secondary endpoint1. Visual acuityThe mean value (90% confidence interval) of naked-eye visual acuity varies by -0.23 (-0.40, -0.07) from the time of enrollment to the end of follow-up, and the mean value of corrected visual acuity (90% confidence interval) is -0.16 (-0.29, -0.03) changed. According to the one-sample t-test, the change in visual acuity was statistically significantly improved at both 0 to significance levels of 10% on both sides.2. Subjective symptomsSubjective symptoms are: 1 bad, 2 somewhat worse, 3 normal, 4 somewhat better, 5 It is rated on a 5-point scale of good. These five levels were considered a continuous quantities and were aggregated by evaluation period. On average, there was a trend toward """"good"""" as the number of days passed after registration.Analysis by mixed ordered logistic regression estimated that the odds ratio (90% confidence interval) per week after enrollment was 1.18 (1.09, 1.29). This means that there is a 18% probability that subjective symptoms will increase by 1 unit (transition in a positive direction) for each week, and a statistically significant improvement in subjective symptoms was observed over time (P = 0.001).3.Time to Healing of Corneal Epithelial DefectThe time to healing of corneal epithelial defect was indicated by the time from the start of treatment to the time when the epithelial injured area first disappeared. The number of days from the start of treatment to the healing of the corneal epithelial defect was 3 days, 7 days, 7 days, and 14 days, and one case was not cured after 84 days.",No,,Yes,False,          ,2022.0,60.0

Seven hundred and sixty seven state schools were included in the trial. Children in both treatment groups were visited at school to confirm their identification details and their arms were examined for BCG scars. Ascertainment of cases was through the tuberculosis control programme. Cases notified were reviewed independently by two chest physicians, who classified cases into confirmed (microbiological confirmation), probable (would treat based on the information from the records), suspected (no information in the record suggested this was not tuberculosis) and not tuberculosis (excluded from the analysis), and into pulmonary and non-pulmonary forms.

Linkage was done blind to vaccination status, based on the name of the child, the name of the mother, the sex and date of birth of the child.
