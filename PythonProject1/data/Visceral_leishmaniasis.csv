Patients with a known allergy for Pentamidine Isethionate.<br>","The disease leishmaniasis, caused by protozoan Leishmania parasites and transmitted via infectedfemale sandflies and reservoir hosts is endemic in 88 countries and 350 million people are at risk. Leishmaniasis prevalence is >12 million cases/year and the incidence is >2.5 million cases/year. The estimated disease burden is 2.4 million DALYs. Leishmaniasis is a category 1 disease (Emerging or uncontrolled diseases) and the World Health Organization (WHO) has acknowledged it as a severely neglected disease and urged intensified research programs to improve vector control, diagnostics and therapeutic arsenal to contain further incidence and morbidity.An infection with Leishmania parasites can, depending of the infecting species, give rise to several distinct clinical manifestations, ranging from localized cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) with single to multiple skin ulcers, satellite lesions or nodular lymphangitis or possibly mucosal involvement and systemic visceral leishmaniasis (VL) with involvement of different organs (like liver and spleen) and bone marrow, which may be lethal. Currently, Pentamidine isethionate is the only drug available for patients with CL in Suriname. Usual care at this moment in Suriname entails a standard treatment regimen of three doses of 4mg/kg body weight Pentamidine Isethionate im. (in 7 days)","In this project, Pentamidine Isethionate treatment will be studied in a randomized controlled trial with 2 treatment arms: <br /><br>1. 4mg/kg body weight im. at day 1, 4 and 7 (control / usual care arm) or <br /><br>2. a short course regime of 7mg/kg body weight im. on day 1 and day 3 (case/ intervention arm).<br /><br>Assuming remission rates of 10% under both treatments, a sample size of 100 patients in each treatment arm was calculated to achieve an 80% power to yield a statistical significant result. Due to an expected 10% dropout in both arms, we aim to enroll a total of 220 patients, with 110 in the usual intervention arm and 110 in the short intervention arm. <br /><br>Considering side effects of treatment, in the control arm these are rarely seen. In the case arm with higher dosage in shorter time, it will be interesting to compare this with the control arm.<br>","To establish if a short course pentamidine isethionate 7 mg/kg body weight given intramuscular at days 1 and 3 (short course) is equally effective as the standard course pentamidine isethionate 4mg/kg intramuscular at days 1, 4 and 7 (standard course) in patients with CL. CL is diagnosed by the detection of leishmaniasis organisms (in a skin smear or a biopsy by light microscope or by the detection of leishmaniasis nucleic acid sequences through NAAT) in a clinically suspected lesion. <br><br /><br /><br>1. A clinical relapse is defined as persistence of one or more leishmaniasis lesions at 6 or 12 weeks after completion of treatment documented by one dermatologist with at least 4 years diagnostic experience in leishmaniasis. All lesions will be photographed (both healed and persisting lesions) and evaluated per visit by a second dermatologist with at least 4 years diagnostic experience in leishmaniasis, who is blinded from the results of the first evaluator. In case of discrepancy between the 2 dermatologist observers, the discrepancy will be solved by a third dermatologist with at least 4 years diagnostic experience in leishmaniasis on the basis of the photographs of the discrepant lesions. The expected success of the standard treatment group is approximately 90%10. To determine whether the treatment success of the short course is equal to that of the standard course, no less than an expected 70% treatment success is considered effective. <br /><br>2. To establish if the short course is equally effective as the standard course as far as parasitological cure rate 6 and 12 weeks after completion of the treatment. A parasitological cure is defined as elimination of leishmania RNA 6 and 12 weeks after completion of the treatment course, in one designated proven leishmania RNA positive lesion before treatment. The short course is considered to have an equal parasitological cure rate, if in the short course arm the rate does not exceed the cure rate in the standard course arm by more than 20% (compared per visit).<br>","1. To establish if the short course has an equal rate of patient reported side effects and clinically determined drug related toxicity events as the standard course. <br>Side effects (recorded at the last treatment visit) are: <br /><br>a. nausea (as indicated by the patient);<br /><br>b. erythema exsudativum multiforme (occurrence of blisters in skin and/or mucosal tissue);<br /><br>c. unknown/other side effects.<br /> <br>Drug related toxicity events (recorded 1 week after treatment and compared to the screenings visit) are: <br /><br>d. hypotension (10mm Hg drop in diastolic blood pressure compared to: the pressure before the injection, measured halfway the injection and 10 minutes after the injection);<br /> <br>e. hemolysis (>1mmol drop in hemoglobin count);<br /> <br>f. leucopenia (drop in leukocytes count < 4 x 10(9)/l);<br /> <br>g. thrombocytopenia (drop in thrombocytes < 150 x 10(9)/l);<br /><br>h. hypoglycemia (drop in glucose < 4 mmol/l);<br /> <br>i. liver toxicity (>2 fold rise in serum transaminases, normal values = <40 U/l));<br /><br>j. nefrotoxicity (kreatinin level rise >10umol/l, normal values = 70-110 umol/l));<br /> <br>k. pancreas toxicity (3 fold rise in amylase, normal value = 32 U/l)). <br /><br>The short course is considered to have an equal rate of side effects or drug related drug toxicity events if in the short course arm the rate does not exceed the rate in the standard course arm by more 20%. <br /><br>2. To establish if the short course is equal to the standard course as far as health related quality of life measured by validated self-report questionnaires. Generic QoL measured by the EQ-5D and EQ-VAS questionnaires and disease-specific QoL measured by the SKINDEX questionnaire. The short course is considered to affect the quality of life equally as the standard course if the quality of life outcome in the short course arm is no lower than the quality of life outcomes in the standard course group by more than 20%. <br /><br>3. To establish if the short course is equal to the standard course as far as the cost-effectiveness based on a cost survey questionnaire. The appropriate type of economic evaluation is conditional on the results of the primary objective (relapse rate) and health related quality-of-life (HR-QoL). In the case of one clearly superior strategy, a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) would be required to combine clinical and economic outcomes. In case of comparable outcomes in clinical effectiveness, a cost-minimization analysis (CMA) would suffice.<br /><br>4. To establish the effect on the patient compliance of the short course regimen versus the standard course regimen. A patient is considered non-compliant for a study visit in case he/she fails to show up more than 24 hours after the consented date and time, without a notification beforehand. The short course is considered to affect the compliance compared to the standard course if the compliance rates between the two regimens differs by more than 20%.
