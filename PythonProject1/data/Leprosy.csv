In phase 1, the Delphi method will be applied, which will consist of consulting a panel of experts to obtain consensus on the criteria and guidelines for structuring a clinical protocol to be used in the intervention, in the subsequent phase of this study, as an auxiliary document in the provision of the pharmacotherapeutic monitoring service. The Delphi method will be conducted in successive rounds of structured questionnaires, seeking convergence of opinions. In phase 2, a quasi-experimental study will be conducted to evaluate before and after the intervention. The study will involve a single-arm research with a comparative evaluation of the effect of the intervention, before and after exposure. This design will allow an evaluation without inter-individual interference, since each participant will be compared with themselves before and after exposure, making the individual themselves their control group. Randomization will not be performed, since all admitted patients will undergo the intervention as part of the care routine. In addition, all participants will be aware of the intervention applied, and there will be no masking in its implementation. In stage 3, a retrospective cross-sectional descriptive observational study will be carried out, in which data will be collected and analyzed from existing records, allowing the construction of indicators to monitor the evolution of the process of implementing the pharmacotherapeutic monitoring service.

The search for affordable alternative treatments has been increasing and, in this sense, the use of natural compounds is being widely explored in the treatment of these injuries, due to their low cost when compared to synthetic medicines. Among the products, propolis has stood out for its healing properties. Brazilian green propolis has shown a significant difference in its chemical composition in relation to other propolis and has therefore become an object of great interest among scientists. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the healing activity of HUMANITAS green propolis ointment in patients with lower limb ulcers resulting from leprosy. Method: The blind and randomized clinical study CAAE: 48002021.0.0000.5514, was carried out at the wound outpatient clinic of the Humanitas Philanthropic Association São Jerônimo da Serra/PR/Brazil, and included the analysis of 18 wounds randomly divided into two groups: propolis ointment G1 and G2 control. The treatment lasted 61 days and patients were evaluated weekly, resulting in 9 evaluations (A0-A8). As assessment instruments, the tracing technique for morphometry and the application of the PUSH scale were used to monitor the evolution and characteristics of the wound. Result: As a result, no participant showed sensitivity to the active ingredient, there was better activity in G1 during the initial phase of treatment, corresponding to the inflammatory and proliferative phases of the healing process and reduction of the lesion area, reduction of inflammatory exudate and formation of a tissue of more revitalized granulation. Conclusion: the use of propolis ointment is safe and promotes tissue repair.","The sample size was composed of 9 patients cured of the lepromatous disease, 7 men and 2 women. The mean age of patients is 64.3 years, ranging from 56 to 72 years, and the mean time that patients had the wound was 7.6 years, ranging from 1 to 20 years. In total, 18 wounds of these 9 patients were treated, which were divided randomly into propolis ointment group - G1 investigational composed of 5 patients and control ointment group - G2 composed of 4 patients.

About 26 million people worldwide annually have a diabetic foot ulcer with another 130 million at risk of diabetic neuropathy. Though the actual burden of ulcers in leprosy is unknown, it is estimated that over 3 million people are living with disability due to leprosy and that 20-50% of patients with peripheral neuropathy due to leprosy will experience ulcers.<br><br>The prevalence of diabetes is 8.4% in India and 8.5% in Nepal. These figures are higher than the global prevalence of 6.3%. About one-third of diabetic patients develop foot ulcers in their lifetime. While the lifetime incidence of foot ulcers in leprosy is not known, an ongoing cross-sectional study on the prevalence of disabilities due to leprosy has shown that over 30% of patients with an anesthetic foot presented with a plantar ulcer. Foot ulcers reduce patient mobility, social interaction, and health-related quality of life. The treatment of foot ulcers increases the substantial burden on healthcare. Therefore, proper management and expedited healing of foot ulcers are important to limit the burden of ulcer care.<br><br>Challenges in the management of plantar ulcers in leprosy and diabetes<br>The role of pressure on the sole of the foot in the pathogenesis of neuropathic plantar ulcers is well established. Continued pressure over the vulnerable site leads to ulcers and then impedes ulcer healing. Therefore, in addition to removing any infection, an effective way to promote the healing of ulcers is rest - either complete bed rest, which is rarely possible or, commonly, rest to the affected part using an off-loading method.

Access to national virtual servers (Ethiopia, Mozambique, Tanzania) is limited to those authorized by institutional research coordinators. Hard copy data are maintained at field sites in secure locations, and for backup and analysis purposes securely transferred from the national virtual server by accessing a virtual machine hosted by Erasmus MC and cut-off from the internet. To ensure privacy and confidentiality, a data pseudonymisation system (participant ID codes) is in place, and personal identifiers (i.e. names) are not entered in the national virtual server or centralised database. Project staff are trained in privacy and confidentiality. Restricted access to the database is implemented using a secure system to prevent unauthorised access. Qualitative data collected in the supporting studies are kept confidential. Interviews, observations, and focus group data are reported only by generic identifying characteristics, (i.e. age).

However, post-intervention, the intervention group showed greater improvement than the control group. Significant effects were observed for group, time, and their interaction, with moderate to large effect sizes. Sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the findings. The training module is recommended for future use to enhance leprosy detection and reduce cases in Malaysia.","There were total of 150 HCWs from 6 districts who worked in primary healthcare clinics that enrolled in this study with 75 HCWs in the intervention group and another 75 HCWs in the control group. The majority of HCWs were female (80%), Malay ethnicity (96.7%), married (82%) and aged 40 years and below (82.7%). For occupation, community nurses (37.3%) were the highest HCWs involved in this study followed by staff nurses (32%) and the majority of HCWs were a diploma background (72%). Half of HCWs had serviced for about 10 years and below. About 51 HCWs (34%) had seen leprosy cases before. Only 8 HCWs (5.3%) had been trained in leprosy training except LaKAR where 7 of them had been trained less than 3 times. Additionally, only 6 HCWs (4%) had seen leprosy cases before and 3 of them had seen more than 3 leprosy patients. Overall, characteristics between the treatment and control groups showed no significant difference between them, and most of the HCWs were distributed well across the group study.The mean score for knowledge was 11.96 in the intervention group and 11.87 in the control group. The overall mean score for knowledge of leprosy among HCWs is 11.91. There were no significant mean differences between the intervention group and the control group for knowledge of leprosy. Moreover, the overall median score for skills of leprosy was 12.00 (7,21). The median score for skills of leprosy in the intervention group was 10.00 (6,22) and 14.00 (11,20) in the control group. There were also no significant median differences between the intervention group and the control group for skills of leprosy at the baseline.","Only 2 HCWs were unable to follow up where 1 HCW in the control group and 1 HCW in the intervention group. One participant in the control group was lost to follow-up due to confinement. An additional participant in the intervention group was lost to follow up at the intervention program as the participant applied for leave for 2 months due to personal reasons.

The overall mean score for knowledge of leprosy among HCWs is 11.91. There were no significant mean differences between the intervention group and control group for knowledge of leprosy. There were improvements in both groups for knowledge of leprosy post-intervention. The intragroup mean difference for knowledge of leprosy in the intervention group and control group were 5.82 (48.7%) and 3.05 (25.7%) respectively and both were statistically significant differences. The intervention group significantly showed greater improvement post-intervention with an intergroup difference of 1.48 (48.5%).Skills scoreThe overall median score for skills of leprosy was 12.00 (7,21). The median score for skills of leprosy in the intervention group and control group were 10.00 (6,22) and 14.00 (11,20) respectively. There were no significant median differences between the intervention group and control group for skills of leprosy at the baseline. There were also improvements in both groups for skills of leprosy post-intervention. The intragroup median difference for skills of leprosy in the intervention group and control group were 35.47 (354.7%) and 18.00 (128.6%) respectively and both were statistically significant differences. In the analysis between the intervention and control group (intergroup), a positive median difference score indicates a greater improvement in the intervention group as compared to the control group. The intervention group showed significantly greater improvement with an intergroup median difference of 17.47 (97.1%).Magnitude effects of intervention on knowledge and skills of leprosy The result revealed a significant main effect for the group, time, and the interaction of the group with time for leprosy-related knowledge. Similarly, the findings of an analysis on skills scores also showed a significant main effect for the group, time, and the interaction of the group with time. Partial eta squared and Cohen d were the measures of effect size. In this study, the effect size was found to be moderate or medium to larger effect using partial eta squared and Cohen d for both knowledge and skills of leprosy.Sensitivity analysisOur study performed sensitivity analysis by comparing the results obtained from the complete data analysis, excluding cases with missing values (Per Protocol), with the primary analysis that employed the Intention to Treat (ITT) analysis using the mean substitution method. Surprisingly, both analyses yielded similar outcomes, indicating that the effect sizes measured using partial eta square and Cohen&#039;s d were statistically significant for the two outcome variables.

One of the conditions for discontinuation of the study, """"the development of three cases of infection or unexplained corneal opacity,"""" did not occurred.","The primary endpoint was improvement in neurotrophic keratopathy, but improvement was judged when one or more of the following two items were satisfied. In the case of corneal epithelial defects, it is the disappearance of corneal epithelial defects from the time of the start of treatment, and in the case of corneal stromal thinning, it is an increase in corneal thickness from the time of treatment initiation. The disappearance of corneal epithelial defects was evaluated based on the area of the epithelial injury, and the increase in corneal thickness in the thin corneal area was evaluated by the thickness of the corneal stroma of the injured area.Improvement in neurotrophic keratopathy was determined in 11 patients, improvement in 10 patients, and no improvement in 1 case.  The rate of improvement in neurotrophic keratopathy was calculated by including discontinuation cases in the denominator of the improvement rate, and was calculated to be 83.3% (90% confidence interval 56.2%~97.0%). The null improvement rate was tested as 15% and was significant with p < 0.00001. Secondary endpoint1.

According to the one-sample t-test, the change in visual acuity was statistically significantly improved at both 0 to significance levels of 10% on both sides.2. Subjective symptomsSubjective symptoms are: 1 bad, 2 somewhat worse, 3 normal, 4 somewhat better, 5 It is rated on a 5-point scale of good. These five levels were considered a continuous quantities and were aggregated by evaluation period. On average, there was a trend toward """"good"""" as the number of days passed after registration.Analysis by mixed ordered logistic regression estimated that the odds ratio (90% confidence interval) per week after enrollment was 1.18 (1.09, 1.29). This means that there is a 18% probability that subjective symptoms will increase by 1 unit (transition in a positive direction) for each week, and a statistically significant improvement in subjective symptoms was observed over time (P = 0.001).3.Time to Healing of Corneal Epithelial DefectThe time to healing of corneal epithelial defect was indicated by the time from the start of treatment to the time when the epithelial injured area first disappeared.

Seven hundred and sixty seven state schools were included in the trial. Children in both treatment groups were visited at school to confirm their identification details and their arms were examined for BCG scars. Ascertainment of cases was through the tuberculosis control programme. Cases notified were reviewed independently by two chest physicians, who classified cases into confirmed (microbiological confirmation), probable (would treat based on the information from the records), suspected (no information in the record suggested this was not tuberculosis) and not tuberculosis (excluded from the analysis), and into pulmonary and non-pulmonary forms.
