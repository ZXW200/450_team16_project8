In each setting, groups of volunteers will be dermally exposed to single-sex (male) cercariae once at doses of between 10 and 30 cercariae. Depending on the outcome of the low dose infection, the dose will be escalated or additional volunteers will be exposed to the same number of cercariae. Volunteers will undergo intensive follow-up for 24 weeks and a late follow-up time point at 52 weeks. They will visit the clinical trial centre weekly after infection for 12 weeks. After this, two-weekly visits will continue until week 24. A final follow up visit will be after one year. During the visits, adverse events will be recorded, levels of Schistosoma mansoni circulating anodic antigen (CAA) will be measured and samples obtained for immunological analyses. Immediately CAA is detected (expected around 6 to 8 weeks after infection) the volunteers will be treated with praziquantel to cure the Schistosoma infection. Praziquantel may be repeated 4 weeks later if CAA levels do not fall to zero. Volunteers will be required to avoid contact with potentially Schistosoma mansoni-contaminated water until the controlled infection has been shown to have been effectively cured, potentially a period of up to 14 weeks.

We examined the impact of a combination of human mass chemotherapy, snail control through mollusciciding and SjCTPI bovine vaccination on the human incidence of infection. Following the baseline survey, the interventions were implemented in 18 intervention groups from 2013 to 2017. The investigators, including the research team, and study participants were blind to the vaccine allocation. At baseline all residents (60 mg/kg directly observed split oral dose) and bovines (30 mg/kg directly feed oral dose) were treated with a directly observed oral dose of PZQ. Villages were then pair-matched for the RCT based on historical prevalence, baseline outcomes, and transmission ecology. One of three intervention ARMs (no specific intervention (control), human mass praziquantel (PZQ) treatment, mollusciciding) were randomly assigned to each pair to achieve three pairs per intervention type. Within each pair, one village was randomly assigned the active vaccine for vaccinating bovines and the other village received a placebo vaccine.

Male or non-pregnant female aged 18 to 50, inclusive. 4. Are in<br>    good health, as determined by vital signs (oral temperature, pulse, and blood pressure),<br>    medical history, and targeted physical examination based on medical history.1 Existing<br>    medical diagnoses or conditions (except those in the Subject Exclusion Criteria) must be<br>    deemed as stable chronic medical conditions. A stable chronic medical condition is defined<br>    as no change in prescription medication, dose, or frequency of medication in the last 3<br>    months (90 days) and health outcomes of the specific disease are considered to be within<br>    acceptable limits in the last 6 months (180 days). Any change due to change of health care<br>    provider, insurance company, or that is done for financial reasons, as long as in the same<br>    class of medication, will not be considered a violation of this inclusion criterion. Any<br>    change in prescription medication due to improvement of a disease outcome, as determined by<br>    the site principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, will not be considered a<br>    violation of this inclusion criterion. Subjects may be on chronic or as needed (prn)<br>    medications if, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or appropriate<br>    sub-investigator, they pose no additional risk to subject safety or assessment of<br>    reactogenicity and immunogenicity. Topical, nasal, and inhaled medications (with the<br>    exception of steroids as outlined in the Subjects Exclusion Criteria), vitamins, and<br>    contraceptives are permitted. 5. Vital signs (oral temperature, pulse, and blood pressure)<br>    are all within normal protocol-defined ranges. Note: The normal protocol-defined ranges for<br>    vital signs include (a) oral temperature less than 100.0°F, (b) pulse 50 to 100 bpm,<br>    inclusive, (c) systolic blood pressure 85 to 150 mmHg, inclusive, and (d) diastolic blood<br>    pressure 55 to 90 mmHg, inclusive. 6. Laboratory tests (alanine aminotransferase,<br>    creatinine, white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets) are all within normal<br>    protocol-defined reference ranges.33 The normal protocol-defined ranges for laboratory<br>    tests include (a) alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 32 IU/L or less for females or 44 IU/L<br>    or less for males, (b) creatinine 1.0 mg/dL or less for females or 1.27 mg/dL or less for<br>    males, (c) white blood cells (WBC) between 3.4 x10^3/uL and 10.8 x10^3/uL, inclusive, (d)<br>    hemoglobin 11.1 g/dL or greater for females or 12.6 g/dL or greater for males, (e)<br>    platelets between 150 x10^3/uL and 379 x10^3/uL, inclusive.
