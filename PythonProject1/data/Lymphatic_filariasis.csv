Both the researcher, who conducted the delivery of the capsules and analysis of the outcomes, and the participants were not aware of the allocation of groups. Experimental groups: Coconut oil group: 13 individuals with lower limb lymphedema, living in an endemic area of lymphatic filariasis, received supplemental capsules (orally) of extra virgin coconut oil. The daily dose was 6g (fractionated into 3 times/day) and the period of use was 70 days. Medium-chain triglycerides (TCM) group: 13 individuals with lower limb lymphedema, living in an endemic area of lymphatic filariasis, received capsules for supplementation (oral use) of TCM oil. The daily dose was 6g (fractionated into 3 times/day) and the period of use was 70 days. Control group: 12 individuals with lower limb lymphedema, living in an endemic area of lymphatic filariasis, received soybean oil supplementation capsules (orally). The daily dose was 6g (fractionated into 3 times/day) and the period of use was 70 days. The capsules used were filled by a pharmacist not connected to the research group, in identical plastic containers, distinguished from each other only by the coding inserted on the label. The capsules had the same color, shape and size, and the bottles were delivered sealed to prevent possible characteristic odors from being exhaled. The meaning of the label encodings was not revealed to the participants or the research group until all data had been collected and analyzed. In this way, researchers and volunteers were blinded to the types of supplements. The","Expected outcome 1: To evaluate the effect of using source oils of medium-chain fatty acids (extra virgin coconut oil and medium-chain triglyceride oil - TCM oil) on the evolution of lymphedema, verified by perimetry of the affected limb, of lower limbs of resident patients in endemic areas for lymphatic filariasis;Outcome found 1: Extra virgin coconut oil was effective in the involution of lymphedema in the study patients. Monitoring the perimetry of the affected limb (over the 70 days of intervention) showed a reduction in measurements that measure the magnitude of lymphedema at different points (foot, leg, knee and thigh). TCM oil did not promote a significant reduction in lymphedema","Expected outcome 2: Evaluate the effect of the intervention on the participants&apos; nutritional status and adiposity, using anthropometric parameters (weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio and hip circumference) and body composition (water, mass lean, fat percentage, body fat index (FMI) and android to gynoid fat ratio);Outcome found 2: In participants who received extra virgin coconut oil: there was a reduction in BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio, hip circumference, body fat percentage and body fat index. In addition, there was an increase in the percentage of fat-free mass. In participants who received TCM oil: there was a reduction in body weight, BMI values, waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio, hip circumference and body fat percentage. In addition, there was an increase in the percentage of fat-free mass;Expected outcome 3: Evaluate the effect of supplementation on the biochemical parameters of metabolism and inflammation in the evaluated patients, using the following dosages: complete blood count, fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol and fractions, triglycerides, albumin, total proteins, ferritin, vitamin B12, vitamin D, protein C-reactive, TNF alpha, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-17;Outcome found 3: No unfavorable changes in lipoproteins associated with atherogenesis and increased cardiometabolic risk were identified in any study group. On the contrary, TCM oil led to a reduction in VLDL and TG levels. And, the modulation exerted on inflammatory markers was due to the elevation of IL-2 and IL-4 levels in patients who received TCM oil. There was a probable trend towards the reduction of pro-inflammatory markers such as TNF-alpha and CRP in all groups;Expected outcome 4: Evaluate the influence of the intervention on the participants&apos; perception of quality of life, using the abbreviated instrument for assessing quality of life - WHOQOL-bref, developed by the World Health Organization. The WHOQOL-bref consists of 26 questions, the first referring to quality of life in general and the second, satisfaction with one&apos;s own health. The remaining 24 questions are translated into facets and cover the physical, psychological, social relations and environment domains;Outcome found 4: The group that received supplementation with extra virgin coconut oil evolved with an improvement in the perception of quality of life and health, characterized by self-perception of quality of life and level of individual satisfaction with health. There was also an improvement in the physical domain of quality of life, determined by the perception of the condition of pain and discomfort, energy and fatigue, sleep and rest, mobility, activities of daily living, dependence on medication or treatments and work ability. Those who received TCM oil did not demonstrate a significant improvement in quality of life. With regard to the facets of the psychological and social relations domains, the average of the values characterized all the study groups with regular quality of life, that is, that needs to be improved;Expected outcome 5: Evaluate the existing correlation between the evolution of lymphedema, throughout the proposed intervention, with the changes in the distribution parameters of body components, through models of Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE);Outcome found 5: Extra virgin coconut oil was effective in the involution of lymphedema in the study patients. In addition, there was a positive association between body mass index (BMI) and body fat index (FMI) with thigh perimetry measurements, throughout the intervention, regardless of gender, age, economic class and physical activity level of the participants. And, in the case of the Baumgartner Index, extra virgin coconut oil showed a negative association with lymphedema, so that each increment in the Baumgartner Index unit led to a reduction in perimetry measurements at different points on the leg and thigh. Thus, although all groups (extra virgin coconut oil, MCT oil and soy oil - control) showed a positive association between BMI and the increase in limb circumference measurements, in the group that received extra virgin coconut oil it was It is evident that adiposity, and not just total body mass, had an effect on the extent of lymphedema.

This study aims to investigate the effect of MCT supplementation on nutritional, metabolic and quality of life parameters in patients with lower limb lymphedema. For this purpose, the participants receivednutritional assistance and were submitted to an assessment of their body composition and determination of their biochemical profile. The assessment of quality of life will occur by applying the WHOQOL BREF (WHO) test. As for the experimental groups, patients were randomly divided according to nutritional supplementation into 3 groups: TCM 100% Group, Coconut Oil Group and Soybean Oil Group - Control. For the evaluation of body composition were used: densitometry by double emission X-ray, bioelectrical impedance and summation of skinfolds. A significance level of 5% was adopted for all tests. All analyzes were performed using Stata 14.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, USA). The use of vegetable oils source of TCM associated with nutritional monitoring promoted a reduction in body mass index, waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio and hip circumference, and an increase in fat-free mass. In addition, extra virgin coconut oil acted in the modulation of adiposity in different evaluation parameters. The modulation exerted on inflammatory markers was due to the elevation of IL-2 and IL-4 levels in patients who received TCM oil. Extra virgincoconut oil was effective in the involution of lymphedema in the patients in this study. In addition, it promoted an improvement in the quality of life in different domains. Nutritional monitoring and supplementation, instituted here, had beneficial effects both in metabolic variables and in the extent of lymphedema, as well as in the perception of quality of life. This integrates the care proposal for patients with lymphedema and favors the individual capacity to exercise citizenship.","The research was carried out at the Outpatient Clinic of the National Reference Service for Filariasis (SRNF) of the Aggeu Magalhães Institute (IAM) of the Oswaldo Cruz de Pernambuco Foundation (Fiocruz – PE), located in the Northeast Region of Brazil, State of Pernambuco. The population analyzed was composed of patients with lymphedema of the lower limbs registered at the outpatient clinic - IAM/Fiocruz-PE. The sample was established by convenience sampling, with an initial estimate of 60 patients over a period of one year, from both genders, aged between 18 and 85 years, with lower limb lymphedema. The diagnosis of lymphedema was made by doctors from that service, based on clinical assessment and the classification criteria of Dreyer et al. (2002). Recruitment was carried out via phone call or in person at the outpatient clinic. The patients underwent an individual interview with clarifications about the objectives, duration and methodological procedures of the research. Clear information was given and details on how nutritional care and monitoring would take place, the proposed nutritional supplementation, the need to carry out biochemical tests and the methods of assessing body composition that would be adopted (double emission X-ray densitometry (DEXA), bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA ) and sum of skinfolds). Patients were informed about the benefits and possible risks inherent to participating in the study. Once they agreed to participate, they signed the free and informed consent form, also counting on two witnesses not related to the research group.","Possible risks inherent to the study: Questions carried out in the nutritional anamnesis, as well as the socioeconomic characterization of the participants and the anthropometric assessment could have caused some discomfort or embarrassment, which was minimized by the fact that the interview/service was conducted by a qualified professional, in an appropriate environment, on an individual basis. The risks inherent in carrying out biochemical tests, such as pain, bruises and/or local discomfort, were minimal, as the collection was carried out by employees qualified in phlebotomy belonging to the Fiocruz-PE outpatient clinic. Regarding double emission X-ray densitometry (DEXA), the patient received an extremely low amount of radiation, reaching values below 6.7 to 31 uSV. To understand the magnitude of these values, it can be compared with 1000 uSV (tomography) or 60 to 200 uSV (radiographic examination). In addition to the low dose of radiation, the exam was carried out in the shortest possible time to minimize this exposure, which did not reflect a potentially harmful risk to patients. DEXA is a technique widely used in clinical practice to determine body compartments (bone mass, muscle mass and fat mass). The detailed body composition assessment informed participants about possible imbalances in the amount of fat and lean mass body, these findings were monitored by the research nutritionist. And the biochemical evaluation provided current knowledge of the lipid and inflammatory profile of the participants. When any changes were identified in biochemical tests, patients were treated by the Fiocruz-PE medical team or referred to various medical specialties for investigation and clinical treatment.","GROUPS: GTC (TCM oil group), GOC (extra virgin coconut oil group), GC (control group). At the beginning of the study, the groups were homogeneous, with differences between them only for the variables age (p=0.045) and income (p=0.018), with the GOC being composed of older individuals and the GTC and GOC with higher monthly income. . Although the GOC had a higher mean level of vitamin B12 (p=0.047), all groups were within reference values. IL-10 levels were at the limit of statistical difference (p=0.050) also for the CG. The mean for quality of life domain 4 was higher in the GTC and GOC groups (p=0.029), however, it is within the same numerical classification range as the other groups - quality of life “in need of improvement”. At the end of the study, the groups remained homogeneous, with differences being found in hemoglobin (p=0.038) and hematocrit (p=0.043) levels, with lower values in the GOC. In relation to data on anthropometric and body composition variables, evaluated by different methods, in the pre and post supplementation period. It is observed that there was a reduction in weight (p&lt;0.001) and Body Mass Index (BMI) (p&lt;0.001) assessed by anthropometry, fat percentage (p=0.025) and Body Fat Index (FMI) (p=0.028 ) assessed by DEXA and increase in the percentage of lean mass (p=0.026), also assessed by DEXA, among patients in the CG. In relation to GOC patients, there was a reduction in BMI values (p=0.048), waist circumference (WC) (0.029), waist-to-height ratio (WHR) (p=0.027), hip circumference (HC) (p= 0.014), fat percentage (p=0.015) assessed by sum of skinfolds and FMI (p=0.033) assessed by DEXA. Furthermore, there was an increase in the percentage of fat-free mass (FFM) (p=0.019), verified by a predictive equation (Durnin; Womersley, 1974). In GTC patients, reductions in weight (p=0.001), BMI (p=0.001), WC (p=0.013), WHR (p=0.012), HC (p=0.016) and fat percentage (p&lt; 0.001) evaluated by the sum of skinfolds, an increase in the FFM percentage (p&lt;0.001) was also found, verified by a predictive equation (Durnin; Womersley, 1974). Regarding biochemical data referring to the pre- and post-supplementation period, according to the experimental group, patients in the CG showed an increase in the concentrations of total proteins (p=0.045), IL-2 (0.026) and IL-4 (0.004) and reduction in leukocyte levels, however, the average values presented before and after supplementation were within the white blood cell count reference values. GOC patients showed an increase in IL-2 concentration (p=0.004) and a reduction in hemoglobin (p=0.014) and hematocrit (p=0.03) levels. While GTC patients had a reduction in the concentrations of VLDL (p=0.017) and triglycerides (0.044), in addition to an increase in the concentrations of IL-2 (p=0.032) and IL-4 (p=0.043). No unfavorable changes in lipoproteins associated with atherogenesis and increased cardiometabolic risk were identified in any group of this study. GC patients showed an improvement in quality of life in relation to the psychological domain (p=0.036). An improvement in the perception of quality of life and health (p=0.010) and quality of life in relation to the physical domain (p=0.034) was also observed among GOC patients. GTC did not demonstrate an improvement in quality of life. Characterization of the perimetry of the limb affected by lymphedema: measurements were taken every 7 centimeters from the zero point (located at the knee). The measurements taken on the thigh were taken from bottom to top, that is, from point zero to the root of the thigh. The measurements taken on the leg were taken from top to bottom, that is, from point zero to the malleolus. The involution of lymphedema occurred in the GOC. There was a reduction in the perimeters 28 of the thigh (p=0.039), 21 of the thigh (0.021), 14 of the thigh (0.031), 7 of the thigh (0.027), knee (p=0.027), 14 of the leg (p=0.013), 21 of the leg (0.028), 28 of the leg (0.007) and malleolus (0.020). Patients in the GC and GTC who did not show a significant reduction in lymphedema. Extra virgin coconut oil was effective in reversing lymphedema in the patients in this study (GOC) and it was evident that adiposity, and not just total body mass, had an effect on the extent of lymphedema. Furthermore, it promoted an improvement in the quality of life in different areas. ",No,,No,False,"          "

Two experienced MD?s (urologist and ultrasonographer) will perform the aspiration together under aseptic conditions in a hospital. To avoid traumata during aspiration (lesions of the testis or intra-scrotal vessels) a disposable needle guide will be affixed to the ultrasound transducer by a clamp. This device will help the urologist to aid in positioning the needle to impede that the needle/drainage tube gets too close to the testis and scrotal vessels and therefore prevents unwanted bleeding or lesions of the tunica vaginalis parietalis and visceralis and the testis. Skin disinfectant and sterile ultrasound gel will be used to prevent infection due to exogenous bacteria. The total amount of fluid surrounding the testis will be obtained. 24 hours after aspiration participants will be visited and scanned again for safety reasons to make sure that no bleeding or infection occurred. In case of any aspiration related problem, the responsible urologist and MD will care for the patient until resolution.
