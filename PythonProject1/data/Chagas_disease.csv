It is hypothesized that employing the drug of choice with a repositioned one, contributes to the establishment of a new effective, well-tolerated low-cost combination therapy for chronic CD patients. From eligibility confirmation, nine (n = 9) participants will be allocated to the first medication treatment level. The treatment will begin with the lowest dose of BZ for 60 days, corresponding to 100 mg/day associated with 250 mg/day of DF. Upon safety confirmation of the lowest dose of BZ, a new group of 9 patients (group II) will receive a higher dose of BZ (200 mg/day BZ + 250 mg/day DF). After confirming the safety of this dose, another group of 9 patients (group III) will receive the maximum recommended dose of BZ, which is 300 mg/day+250 mg/day DF. Directly after the completion of group III, we will start group IV with 9 others patients receiving the lowest dose of BZ, however associated with 500mg/day of DF. The scheduling scheme will be similar to that previously described for BZ dose progression.
