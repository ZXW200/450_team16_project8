The disease is contracted through the bite of an infected blackfly of the genus Simulium, which transmits third-stage infective larvae. An estimated 18 million people suffer from onchocerciasis, with 99% cases in 31 African countries, and 187 million people at risk Onchocercal dermatitis is the most common symptom of the disease, but severe visual impairment and blindness are the most severe complication, and onchocerciasis is the world’s second-leading infectious cause of blindness. Programs for the treatment and control of onchocerciasis through mass drug administration of ivermectin have been in place for over 20 years. However, they require patients to be given treatment (ivermectin) at regular intervals for the life of the adult worm (up to 15 years), making implementation extremely difficult in endemic countries.
