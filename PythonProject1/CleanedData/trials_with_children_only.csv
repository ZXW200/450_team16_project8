Access to national virtual servers (Ethiopia, Mozambique, Tanzania) is limited to those authorized by institutional research coordinators. Hard copy data are maintained at field sites in secure locations, and for backup and analysis purposes securely transferred from the national virtual server by accessing a virtual machine hosted by Erasmus MC and cut-off from the internet. To ensure privacy and confidentiality, a data pseudonymisation system (participant ID codes) is in place, and personal identifiers (i.e. names) are not entered in the national virtual server or centralised database. Project staff are trained in privacy and confidentiality. Restricted access to the database is implemented using a secure system to prevent unauthorised access. Qualitative data collected in the supporting studies are kept confidential. Interviews, observations, and focus group data are reported only by generic identifying characteristics, (i.e. age). Standards for data storage include security (i.e. antivirus/firewalls), regular backups, easy access for authorized users and measures to prevent theft of tablets/laptops/desktops.
