Access to national virtual servers (Ethiopia, Mozambique, Tanzania) is limited to those authorized by institutional research coordinators. Hard copy data are maintained at field sites in secure locations, and for backup and analysis purposes securely transferred from the national virtual server by accessing a virtual machine hosted by Erasmus MC and cut-off from the internet. To ensure privacy and confidentiality, a data pseudonymisation system (participant ID codes) is in place, and personal identifiers (i.e. names) are not entered in the national virtual server or centralised database. Project staff are trained in privacy and confidentiality. Restricted access to the database is implemented using a secure system to prevent unauthorised access. Qualitative data collected in the supporting studies are kept confidential. Interviews, observations, and focus group data are reported only by generic identifying characteristics, (i.e. age).

Following the baseline survey, the interventions were implemented in 18 intervention groups from 2013 to 2017. The investigators, including the research team, and study participants were blind to the vaccine allocation. At baseline all residents (60 mg/kg directly observed split oral dose) and bovines (30 mg/kg directly feed oral dose) were treated with a directly observed oral dose of PZQ. Villages were then pair-matched for the RCT based on historical prevalence, baseline outcomes, and transmission ecology. One of three intervention ARMs (no specific intervention (control), human mass praziquantel (PZQ) treatment, mollusciciding) were randomly assigned to each pair to achieve three pairs per intervention type. Within each pair, one village was randomly assigned the active vaccine for vaccinating bovines and the other village received a placebo vaccine.
